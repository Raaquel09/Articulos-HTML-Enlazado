        "abstract": "AbstractResearch software is a fundamental and vital part of research worldwide, yet there remainsignificant challenges to software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability.Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open sourcesoftware and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities, butimproving the sharing of research software has not yet been a strong focus of the latter.To improve the FAIRness of research software, the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS)Working Group has sought to understand how to apply the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientificdata management and stewardship to research software, bringing together existing and newcommunity efforts. Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles can be directly applied to researchsoftware by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, specificcharacteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuousevolution and versioning — make it necessary to revise and extend the principles.This document presents the first version of the FAIR Principles for Research Software(FAIR4RS Principles). It is an outcome of the FAIR for Research Software Working Group(FAIR4RS WG).The FAIR for Research Software Working Group is jointly convened as an RDA Working Group,FORCE11 Working Group, and Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Task Force.Date Version Number Description Editor(s)9/6/2021 0.3 Draft for formalcommunity reviewNeil Chue Hong7/6/2021 0.2.1 Amended abstractand text of F1, F1.1,F1.2, F4 and R1 forreview by draftinggroupNeil Chue Hong1/6/2021 0.2 Second draft forreview by FAIR4RSSteering CommitteeNeil Chue Hong17/5/2021 0.1 First draft for reviewby FAIR4RS WGNeil Chue Hong,Michelle Barker2Table of ContentsIntroduction 4Aims 5Previous work 6Development of the FAIR4RS Principles 7FAIR Principles for Research Software 9Findable 9Accessible 11Interoperable 12Reusable 13Challenges to implementation 15The path to adoption 16Acknowledgements 17",
