Reusing and re-purposingworkflows allow scientists to donew experiments faster, since the workflows capture useful expertise from others. As workflow librariesgrow, scientists face the challenge of finding workflows appropriate for their task, understanding whateachworkflow does, and reusing relevant portions of a givenworkflow.We believe that workflowswouldbe easier to understand and reuse if high-level views (abstractions) of their activities were available inworkflow libraries. As a first step towards obtaining these abstractions, we report in this paper on theresults of a manual analysis performed over a set of real-world scientific workflows from Taverna, Wings,Galaxy and Vistrails. Our analysis has resulted in a set of scientific workflowmotifs that outline (i) the kindsof data-intensive activities that are observed in workflows (Data-Operation motifs), and (ii) the differentmanners in which activities are implemented within workflows (Workflow-Oriented motifs). These motifsare helpful to identify the functionality of the steps in a given workflow, to develop best practices forworkflow design, and to develop approaches for automated generation of workflow abstractions.© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionA scientific workflow is a template defining the set of tasksneeded to carry out a computational experiment [1]. Scientificworkflows have been increasingly used in the last decade as an in-strument for data intensive science. Workflows serve a dual func-tion: first, as detailed documentation of the scientific method usedfor an experiment (i.e. the input sources and processing steps takenfor the derivation of a certain data item), and second, as re-usable,∗ Corresponding author.
