available in Pypi!](https://pypi.org/project/somef/). To install it just type:\n\n```\npip install somef\n```\n\n## Install from GitHub\nTo run SOMEF, please follow the next steps:\n\nClone this GitHub repository\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef.git\n```\n\nInstall somef (you should be in the folder that you just cloned). Note that for Python 3.7 and 3.8 the module Cython should be installed in advanced (through the command: `pip install Cython`).\n\n```\ncd somef\npip install -e .\n```\n\nRun SOMEF\n\n```bash\nsomef --help\n```\n\nIf everything goes fine, you should see:\n\n```bash\nUsage: somef [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  configure  Configure credentials\n  describe   Running the Command Line Interface\n  version    Show somef version.\n```\n\n\n<!--## Install from Pypi \nJust type:\n\n```bash\npip install somef\n```\n\n!!! info\n    Feature under development\n-->\n\n## Installing Through Docker\nWe provide a Docker image with SOMEF already installed. To run through Docker, you may build the Dockerfile provided in the repository by running:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t somef .\n```\nOr just use the Docker image already built in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kcapd/somef):\n\n```bash\ndocker pull kcapd/somef\n```\n\nThen, to run your image just type:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it kcapd/somef /bin/bash\n```\n\nAnd you will be ready to use SOMEF (see section below). If you want to have access to the results we recommend [mounting a volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). For example, the following command will mount the current directory as the `out` folder in the Docker image:\n\n```bash \ndocker run -it --rm -v $PWD/:/out kcapd/somef /bin/bash\n```\nIf you move any files produced by somef into `/out`, then you will be able to see them in your current directory.\n\n## Configure\nBefore running SOMEF, you must configure it appropriately. Run:\n\n```bash\npython -m nltk.downloader wordnet\npython -m nltk.downloader omw-1.4\n```\nTo download two wordnet modules needed. Then run:\n\n```bash\nsomef configure\n```\n\nAnd you will be asked to provide the following: \n\n- A GitHub authentication token [**optional, leave blank if not used**], which SOMEF uses to retrieve metadata from GitHub. If you don't include an authentication token, you can still use SOMEF. However, you may be limited to a series of requests per hour. For more information, see [https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) \n- The path to the trained classifiers (pickle files). If you have your own classifiers, you can provide them here. Otherwise, you can leave it blank\n\nIf you want to configure SOMEF with the default parameters, just type:\n\n```bash\nsomef configure -a\n```\n\nFor showing help about the available options, run:\n\n```bash\nsomef configure --help\n```\nWhich displays:\n\n```bash\nUsage: somef configure [OPTIONS]\n\n  Configure GitHub credentials and classifiers file path\n\nOptions:\n  -a, --auto  Automatically configure SOMEF\n  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.\n```", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/SM2KG/master/docs/install.md"}, {"result": {"value": "SOMEF [is available in Pypi!](https://pypi.org/project/somef/) To install it just type:\n\n```\npip install somef\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Install from Pypi", "parent_header": ["Software Metadata Extraction Framework (SOMEF)"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/SM2KG/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "To run SOMEF, please follow the next steps:\n\nClone this GitHub repository\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef.git\n```\n\nWe use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to ensure library compatibility.
