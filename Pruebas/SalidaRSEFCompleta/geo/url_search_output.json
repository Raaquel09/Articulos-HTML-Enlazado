The growing availability of geospatial data online, theincreased use of crowdsourced maps and the advent of geospatial mash-ups have led to systems that deliver data to users after integration frommany sources. In such systems, understanding the provenance of geospa-tial data is crucial for assessing the quality of the data and decidingon whether to rely on the data for decision making. To be able to useand analyze provenance in geospatial integration systems in a princi-pled manner, we identify different levels of provenance in the geospatialdomain, provide a set of provenance questions from the point of viewof end users, and relate our geospatial provenance model to the W3CPROV recommendation.1 IntroductionThe Open Geospatial Consortium and the World Wide Web Consortium areworking jointly towards standards for linking and integrating geospatial data [1].As geospatial data is often used in decision making (e.g., navigation), the accu-racy of integrated data is important. While we specifically cover provenancefor geospatial information, some of these challenges are present in many otherdomains as well. The area of geospatial data integration is a prime scenariofor provenance management, as the involved data and systems are complex andexhibit many challenging characteristics:– External sources: when integrating two geospatial datasets, an algorithm mightconsult other sources.– Human-in-the-loop processes: in some cases, the integration might involvemanual intervention, to check particular values by seeking additional confir-mation or even perhaps with eyes on target.– Crowdsourcing: datasets may have been collected from many small contribu-tions, which should attacj provenance too.c© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015B.

Garijo et al.– Granularity: geospatial information may be represented at different levels ofgranularity in space; a geographical feature can be a point in space (e.g., aroad intersection), a one-dimensional segment (e.g., a bridge that connectstwo points) or a two-dimensional region (e.g., a parking lot).– Computation: spatial reasoning may be needed to compute relationshipsbetween features; the integration system may have to integrate computedrelations from different sources.– Versioning: maps are updated as the original data sources are updated. Theobjects in a map themselves can have multiple revisions.We present an initial study on the requirements and challenges of trackinggeospatial provenance, based on discussions with researchers and practitionersat several meetings and workshops on geospatial data.2 Geospatial Provenance ModelBefore we explain how to apply the W3C PROV standard model [2] to thegeospatial domain, we present a classification of provenance levels on geospatialdata:– Dataset-level provenance: provenance assertions about a map as a single entity.The map contains objects, and these objects contain properties and values,but provenance is associated with the map as a whole.",
