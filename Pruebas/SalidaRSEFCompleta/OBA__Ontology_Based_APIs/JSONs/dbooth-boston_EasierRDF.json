We've seen the emergence of NoSQL databases, e.g. CouchDB for keyed access to JSON. There is a need for fine grained links between data, and this is driving rapid growth of interest in graph data.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a lack of interoperability across existing graph data solutions, motivating interest in open standards for an interchange framework. RDF is an appealing vendor neutral framework for graph data and well positioned to take on the role of an interchange framework as well as being a flexible data/metadata framework in its own right.\n\nIt is now timely to build upon two decades of experience with RDF to examine how we can make RDF easier to use, especially as businesses are under pressure to find effective agile solutions for managing information across large numbers of heterogeneous data silos distributed throughout the enterprise.
