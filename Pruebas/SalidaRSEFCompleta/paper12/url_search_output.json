The web contains millions of useful spreadsheets and CSVfiles, but these files are difficult to use in applications because they usea wide variety of data layouts and terminology. We present Table ToWikidata Mapping Language (T2WML), a language that makes it easyto map and link arbitrary spreadsheets and CSV files to the Wikidatadata model. The output of T2WML consists of Wikidata statementsthat can be loaded in the public Wikidata, or loaded in a Wikidataclone, creating an augmented Wikidata knowledge graph that applicationdevelopers can query using SPARQL.1Keywords: Knowledge Graphs, RDF, Entity Linking, Wikidata1 IntroductionThe web contains millions of useful spreadsheets and CSV files, including datafrom many government and international organizations. Organizations that offerdata often have web sites where users can search, browse and download dataon a large number of topics. Most institutions offer their data in Excel andCSV formats. The downloaded data is seldom directly usable because, unlikedatabases, which use one column per variable, spreadsheets often arrange thedata in different layouts.Fig. 1 illustrates the problem using data about homicide rates in differentcountries, downloaded from the United Nations web site2. We truncated andcolored the files for ease of presentation. The cells with the homicide numbersare highlighted in green, the cells that provide contextual information for thevalue are highlighted in blue, and header cells are highlighted in dark blue.Fig. 1a shows the layout of the data provided in the UN website; Fig. 1b showsa more compact representation using multi-level headers; Fig. 1c shows a layout1 Copyright (c) 2019 for this paper by its authors.

Intentional Homicide Data (Excel file downloaded from dataunodc.un.org)that could be used to store the data in a database, and that can be used directlyin tools such as Pandas; Fig. 1d illustrates a common convention for arrangingdata by topic, by creating stacked tables that share common headings. All tablespresent the same homicide data. The interpretation of each value is defined byfour cells (country, year, population and source) that identify the context for avalue. In each table, the context cells are located in different parts of the data.Only in Fig. 1c (Database) the context cells are in the same row as the value; inthe other tables, context cells appear in different rows, in header rows (examplesa and b), or in visually distinct rows within the table (example d).Existing languages for mapping structured data to RDF, including R2RML3,RML [1], Karma [3] and CSV2RDF [2] process tabular data row by row, requiringtabular data to be in database format (Fig. 1c). RML supports non-tabularformats (JSON and XML) and Karma provides folding and unfolding operatorsto rearrange data for row-based processing. None support complex layouts suchas those in examples b or d.T2WML is a mapping language designed to meet three objectives: 1) Identifyand map data and their context qualifiers in arbitrary data layouts found in Exceland CSV files without the need of complex preprocessing steps to transformtables into a canonical \"Database\" representation; 2) Enable users who are not",
