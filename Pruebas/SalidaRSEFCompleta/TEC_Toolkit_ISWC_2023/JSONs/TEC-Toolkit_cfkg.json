If you'd like to suggest new data sources, please open an issue providing its metadata and download options. Make sure it has an open license!\n\n### Contributing with a mapping\nMappings for existing open datasets are welcome. In order for your mapping to be acceptable, it should be based on a standard/well known tool, so we can reproduce it. Create your mapping in a new folder and propose your pull request (see below)\n\n#### Make changes locally\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n   - Using GitHub Desktop:\n     - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.\n     - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)!\n   - Using the command line:\n     - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.\n2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!\n\n### Commit your update\n\nCommit the changes once you are happy with them.\n\nAlways write a clear log message for your commits.\nOne-line messages are fine for small changes.\n\n### Pull Request\n\nWhen you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.\n\n- Link your PR to the issue it addresses.\n- Push your PR to the `dev` branch.
