Please [backup your workspace directory](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/installing#set-where-data-is-stored) before installing and report any problems that you encounter.\r\n\r\n## New in 3.7.9\r\n\r\nSigning of the MacOS package was fixed.\r\n\r\n## Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n* (fixed since 3.7.8) The fix for the MySQL vulnerabilities CVE-2023-41886 and CVE-2023-41887 was corrected, as it still allowed reading arbitrary files or executing code on the machine running OpenRefine using a different set of import parameters in the database extension. This problem bears the vulnerability id CVE-2024-23833, reported by @l0n3rs.\r\n* (fixed since 3.7.5) A moderate vulnerabilities in the database extension was fixed. Connecting to a malicious MySQL server could read files or execute arbitrary code on the machine running OpenRefine. The vulnerabilities were assigned CVE-2023-41886 and CVE-2023-41887\r\n  identifiers respectively, and were reported by @nbxiglk0.\r\n* (fixed since 3.7.4) A moderate vulnerability in project import was fixed. Importing a maliciously crafted project could execute arbitrary code on the machine running OpenRefine. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE-2023-37476 identifier. It was reported by Stefan Schiller from SonarSource.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n* Most text exposed to users in OpenRefine's UI can now be translated. Some strings (generated server-side) were not translatable so far. To help translators catch up on this backlog, do not hesitate to [join us on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/openrefine/). ([#5030](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5030))\r\n* New media files can be uploaded to Wikibase instances such as Wikimedia Commons. The wikitext of existing files can also be edited thanks to the new fields introduced. ([#4682](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4682))\r\n* A button \"Discover Wikibase instances\u2026\" was added on the dialog which lists the registered Wikibase instances ([#5007](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5007)), whose design was improved ([#5009](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5009))\r\n* In the Wikibase schema editor, statements with non-standard datatypes (such as EDTF dates or musical notations) are now supported, assuming they use strings as underlying representation ([#3263](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3263))\r\n* The Wikibase issues tab now makes it possible to locate which rows are responsible for certain issues, using facets ([#5033](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5033))\r\n* The default throttle delay for the \"Add column by fetching URLs\" operation was reduced to 500ms and the error reporting for this field was improved ([#5188](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5188))\r\n* Wikibase templates (incomplete Wikibase schemas) can be saved and shared, as a way of helping contributors use the same way of structuring data in a Wikibase instance ([#5043](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5043), [#5303](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5303))\r\n* The line-based importer now supports a custom delimiter, instead of only newlines ([#4103](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4103))\r\n* The Excel importer can be configured to import all cells as text, disabling the use of other datatypes supported by OpenRefine ([#4838](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4838))\r\n* The \"some value\" and \"no value\" Wikibase values can now be uploaded by OpenRefine ([#5360](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5360))\r\n* The Excel importer will also avoid coercing cell values to OpenRefine datatypes which do not fully fit them, such as representing a date as a date with time ([#5389](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5389), [#5390](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5390)).\r\n\r\n\r\n## GREL changes\r\n* Improved error handling in number formatting with the GREL `toString` function ([#816](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/816))\r\n* The behaviour of the GREL function `wholeText()` has changed slightly in the way it handles newlines, following [an upstream change in the jsoup library](https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.15.1) (jsoup issue [#1636](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636))\r\n* A new `parent` GREL function, to obtain the parent element of an XML element, was added ([#5176](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5176))\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* The layout of the dialog to select a reconciliation match was improved so that the auto-complete widget does not hide the other options ([#4821](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4821))\r\n* Better in-tool documentation around the way the scatterplot facet detects numerical columns ([#4890](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4890))\r\n* The detection of URLs in cell values was fixed ([#4546](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4546))\r\n* The error message displayed when trying to add a Wikibase manifest with a manifest version that is too old or recent was improved ([#4847](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4847))\r\n* Errors returned by Jython expressions are more readable ([#3012](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3012))\r\n* The ODS exporter no longer creates a default sheet \"Sheet1\" in the documents it creates ([#4864](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4864))\r\n* Longer descriptions in auto-completion widget are not cut off anymore ([#4988](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4988))\r\n* The interface for editing cell values was improved to better explain how to input dates ([#3082](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3082))\r\n* The Windows `refine.bat` script was made more consistent with the Unix `refine` script ([#4949](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/4949), [#5404](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5404))\r\n* The \"Search for Match\" dialog was rearranged so that the dropdown does

column dialog\" can be submitted by pressing \"Enter\" in the column field ([#5143](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5143))\r\n* The editing of redirected Wikibase items was fixed ([#5162](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5162))\r\n* The user experience was improved in the case of incomplete Wikibase schemas ([#5131](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5131))\r\n* The memory usage display was improved to show the used memory instead of the total memory, and was made more precise ([#5222](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5222))\r\n* The association of labels to form inputs was improved, enhancing the accessibility of the interface ([#5239](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5239), [#5242](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5242), [#5249](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5249),

The code of conduct is\nobligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.\nFurther details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject contributors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good\nfaith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other\nmembers of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4,\navailable at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq\n\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"}], "contributing_guidelines": [{"result": {"value": "The OpenRefine project welcomes contributions in a variety of forms.\nThis document contains information a few of the ways you can contribute to the OpenRefine project.\nPlease also review our [Governance model](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)\n\n## Provide peer user support\n\nWe welcome users to the [OpenRefine forum](https://forum.openrefine.org/) to ask questions and request assistance.\nIf you can help answer questions in your area of expertise, it would be a benefit to the community.\n\nIf a forum discussion determines there is a bug in OpenRefine or a new feature is identified,\nwe welcome bug reports and feature requests. Please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues) first to make sure\nthe bug / feature hasn't already been added. Note: the development team principally works from the issue\ntracker, so anything not included there risks getting lost.\n\n## Promote OpenRefine\n\nPromoting OpenRefine is a great way to give back. Did you write a tutorial or article about OpenRefine on your blog or site?\nAre you organizing a workshop or presentation for OpenRefine in your city? Let us, and the community, know via our [forum](https://forum.openrefine.org/) or social media.\n\n## Contribute translations\n\nWe want OpenRefine to be available in as many languages as possible to serve\nthe biggest community of users. You can help us [translate OpenRefine](https://docs.openrefine.org/technical-reference/translating-ui) into languages you are fluent in [via Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/openrefine/?utm_source=widget).\nAlthough we have the beginnings of translations for many languages, only a few are complete and popular languages\nlike Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, and French could use help.\n\n## Contribute documentation\n\nWhen browsing our [user manual](https://openrefine.org/docs/) or other documentation, feel free to use the edit button to suggest improvements.\nFor large changes, you might want to first discuss your proposed changes on the forum and then [prepare your changes locally](https://openrefine.org/docs/technical-reference/documentation-contributions).\n\n##  Contribute code \n\nYou can contribute code in various ways:\n- Fix bugs or implement new features. Follow [our guide towards your first code contribution](https://openrefine.org/docs/technical-reference/code-contributions)\n- Improve test coverage. Much of our code was originally written without tests, so help on this front is very much appreciated.\n- Develop an OpenRefine extension\n- Develop a reconciliation service\n\nAll developers including new distributions and plugin developers are invited to leverage the following OpenRefine project management areas.\n- the [official documentation](https://openrefine.org/docs/) for shared documentation between both user docs and [technical reference](https://docs.openrefine.org/technical-reference/contributing)\n- the [developer forum](https://forum.openrefine.org/c/dev/8) for technical questions, new feature development and anything code related. We invite you to share your idea there first. Someone may be able to point out to existing development saving you hours of research and development.\n- the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues) for requesting new features and bug reports.\n- [Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/OpenRefine/OpenRefine) (only occasionally monitored)\n\n### How to submit PR's (pull requests), patches, and bug fixes\n\nAll code changes are made via GitHub Pull Requests which are reviewed before merging, even those by core committers.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with git, GitHub, or open source development, please see [our guide towards your first code contribution](https://openrefine.org/docs/technical-reference/code-contributions).\n\n- If you are looking for something to work on, please see our [issue list](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues). We have a separate tag for [Good First Issues](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22).\n\n- create a branch named with the issue number and a brief description\n- avoid changes unrelated to fixing the issue\n- create unit and/or end-to-end tests which cover the bug fix or new feature\n- run `./refine lint` before submitting your PR (CI will fail if lint fails)\n- make sure all tests are green before submitting your PR\n- we attempt to prioritize PR reviews, but please be patient\n\n### New functionality via extensions\n\nOpenRefine supports a plugin architecture to extend its functionality. You can find more information on how to write\nan extension on our [website](https://openrefine.org/docs/technical-reference/writing-extensions).\nGiuliano Tortoreto also wrote separate documentation detailing how to build an extension for OpenRefine.\n[PDF](https://github.com/giTorto/OpenRefineExtensionDoc/blob/master/main.pdf) and [LaTeX](https://github.com/giTorto/OpenRefineExtensionDoc/) versions are available. It dates from 2014, but still contains good information.\n\nIf you want your extension included in the [list of extensions](https://openrefine.org/extensions) advertised on openrefine.org,\nplease submit a pull request on the download page, please edit [this file](https://github.com/OpenRefine/openrefine.org/blob/master/src/pages/extensions.md).\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1,
