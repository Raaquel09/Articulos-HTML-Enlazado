project!\n\nTo get an overview of the project, please read the [README](README.md).\n\n## Getting started\n\nPlease check to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes.\n\n### Issues\n\n#### Create a new issue\n\nIf you spot a problem or want to suggest an enhancement, [search if it already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).\nIf a related issue does not exist, you can open a new issue here on GitHub.\n\n#### Solve an issue\n\nScan through our existing issues to find one that interests you.\nYou can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.\nAs a general rule, we don't assign issues to anyone.\nIf you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.\n\n### Make Changes\n\n#### Make changes locally\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n   - Using GitHub Desktop:\n     - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.\n     - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)!\n   - Using the command line:\n     - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.\n2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!\n\n### Commit your update\n\nCommit the changes once you are happy with them.\n\nAlways write a clear log message for your commits.\nOne-line messages are fine for small changes.\n\n### Pull Request\n\nWhen you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.\n\n- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.\n- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.\nOnce you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal.\nWe may ask questions or request additional information.\n- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments.\nYou can apply suggested changes directly through the UI.\nYou can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.\n- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).\n- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.\n\n### Your PR is merged\n\nCongratulations and Thanks for your contribution.\n\n",
