We present an approach that facili-16tates the dissemination of hydrological models, and its implementation in the Model INTegra-17tion (MINT) framework. Our approach follows principles from software engineering to create18software components that reveal only selected functionality of models which is of interest to19users while abstracting from implementation complexity, and to generate metadata for the model20components. This methodology makes the models more findable, accessible, interoperable, and21reusable in support of FAIR principles. We showcase ourmethodology and its implementation in22MINT using two case studies. We illustrate how the models SWAT and MODFLOW are turned23into software components by hydrology experts, and how users without hydrology expertise can24find, adapt, and execute them. The two models differ in terms of represented processes and in25model design and structure. Our approach also benefits expert modelers, by simplifying model26sharing and the execution of model ensembles. MINT is a general modeling framework that uses27artificial intelligence techniques to assist users, and is released as open-source software.2829ORCID(s):First Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 1 of 37Short Title of the ArticleHighlights30• An approach that facilitates hydrological model dissemination from expert modelers to non-experts31• Software engineering methods are proposed to simplify model complexity by creating software components32• Non-experts can easily modify selected parameters and execute models provided by experts33• Our approach makes models more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable in support of FAIR principles34• Various applications benefited from this approach within the MINT framework35First Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 2 of 37Short Title of the Article1. Introduction36Hydrological models (HMs) are commonly used for water resources management and are mainly developed and37used by expert researchers or engineers working in the water sector. The results of HMs are important and considered38in decision-making processes of government agencies (Ruiz-Ortiz et al., 2019; Andreu et al., 1996). HM applications39include estimation of water availability (Döll et al., 2003), development of water management strategies (Haasnoot40et al., 2011), flood risk assessment (Merz et al., 2010), climate impact analysis (Krysanova and Hattermann, 2017;41Lobanova et al., 2018; Hattermann et al., 2018), solute transport (Konikow, 2010; Morales et al., 2010) and spatial42characterization of hydrological system variables such as soil water content (Brocca et al., 2017), desalination and43industrial wastewater treatment (Panagopoulos, 2022) as well as groundwater heads (Reinecke et al., 2019). HMs44vary widely in terms of their mathematical description of prevalent hydrological processes and their spatial model45structure, ranging from lumped conceptual models (Bittner et al., 2018; Booij and Krol, 2010) to distributed physical46models (Brunner and Simmons, 2012; Newman et al., 2017).47A fundamental understanding of hydrological processes is needed in order to reasonably set up a hydrologicalmodel48for a new region or modeling problem. This may become an obstacle for the use of HMs by decision-makers and other49users (Lüke and Hack, 2018). In practice, model results are presented to decision-makers as a summary focusing only50on a few specific variables of interest, such as streamflow or groundwater heads. The interests and requirements of51decision-makers and various stakeholders can diverge widely from what may be hydrologically interesting. Decision52makers in water resources management are usually interested in the assessment of the water balance, primarily the53availability of water in space and time. HMs allow a holistic view on the components of the water cycle, from which54insightful information, e.g. limiting factors in space and/or time, can be derived. These variables do not necessarily be55restricted towater availability, but could also refer to evapotranspiration, soil water or precipitation. Miscommunication56between science and non-expert groups is therefore not a rarity (Timmerman and Langaas, 2005). This increases the57",
