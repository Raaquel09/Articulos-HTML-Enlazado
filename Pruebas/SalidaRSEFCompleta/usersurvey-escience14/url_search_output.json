        "abstract": "Abstract—Workflow reuse is a major benefit of workflow systems and shared workflow repositories, but there are barely any studies that quantify the degree of reuse of workflows or the practical barriers that may stand in the way of successful reuse.  In our own work, we hypothesize that defining workflow fragments improves reuse, since end-to-end workflows may be very specific and only partially reusable by others.  This paper reports on a study of the current use of workflows and workflow fragments in labs that use the LONI Pipeline, a popular workflow system used mainly for neuroimaging research that enables users to define and reuse workflow fragments. We present an overview of the benefits of workflows and workflow fragments reported by users in informal discussions. We also report on a survey of researchers in a lab that has the LONI Pipeline installed, asking them about their experiences with reuse of workflow fragments and the actual benefits they perceive.  This leads to quantifiable indicators of the reuse of workflows and workflow fragments in practice. Finally, we discuss barriers to further adoption of workflow fragments and workflow reuse that motivate further work.  Keywords— scientific workflows; workflow fragments; workflow reuse; LONI Pipeline I.  INTRODUCTION Workflows have many benefits to scientists managing complex data analysis [8] [7] [9] [20]. They make it easier to reuse expert-grade methods and the software that implements them, helping newcomers understand complex multi-step data analysis methods, and can track provenance and facilitate reproducibility. Workflow reuse is often cited as a major benefit of workflows, and has been studied in repositories of workflows [19]. However, there are no studies on the level of reuse of workflows in practice in research laboratories.  We are also particularly interested in whether workflow fragments are more reusable than entire workflows [5]. This paper reports on a study on workflow reuse in labs that use a particular workflow system, the LONI Pipeline [3] [4].  The LONI Pipeline includes facilities for users to define subsets of workflows as “groupings” that may be reused by themselves and with others in new workflows. The community of the LONI Pipeline users provides a unique opportunity to study how workflow fragments are used in practice, whether they improve reuse, and the barriers that users find in reusing workflow fragments. The main contributions of this paper are twofold.  First, it articulates the benefits of workflows and workflow fragments reported by users in a neuroscience research lab.  Although many of these benefits such as reuse and time savings have been discussed in the context of workflows, others are not commonly highlighted, such as promoting standards, facilitating debugging, and teaching newcomers to the lab.
