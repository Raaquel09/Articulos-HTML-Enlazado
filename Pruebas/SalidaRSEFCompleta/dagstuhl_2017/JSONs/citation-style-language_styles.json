repository is the only repository of its kind, is used by dozens of third-party software products, and is relied upon by hundreds of thousands of users.\nThe popularity of this repository is in large part due to its crowd-sourced nature, and, we believe, also due to our careful curation.\nWhile we evaluate style submissions on a case-by-case basis, we generally use the following criteria for inclusion in the CSL style repository: \n* Styles must be of sufficient quality and meet our [style requirements](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/STYLE_REQUIREMENTS.md).\n  While we may be able to assist with this, its ultimately the submitter's responsibility to provide a style that meets our standards.\n* Styles should be based on an official style guide (and link to the style guide in online or printed form).\n* Styles should be of interest to a wider audience.\n  We are happy to accept styles with a niche audience, but as a rule of thumb, style submitters should not know all individuals who would be interested in their style.\n  If you do, it's generally better to distribute your style to them yourself. \nBased on these criteria, we generally accept: \n* styles for journals with open (unsolicited) submissions (and styles for publishers of such journals).\n* styles for published style guides, such as those from professional organizations, universities, and university departments. \n* styles for personal use, or for internal use within small organizations.\n* styles solely for use with an (internal) API. \n", "original_header": "Criteria for inclusion"}, "confidence": 0.914230579985, "technique": "supervised_classification",

version, styles in \"master\" are automatically copied to a branch named after the latest version of CSL (e.g. \"v1.0.2\" when CSL 1.0.2 is the latest version).\nOnce a new version of CSL is released (e.g. CSL 1.1.0), \"master\" will upgrade to that version, after which styles will be copied from \"master\" to a new version branch (\"v1.1.0\").\nVersion branches for old versions of CSL are kept but typically become dormant, as for these branches we generally stop maintenance, won't accept third-party contributions via pull requests, nor backport changes made to styles in \"master\". \nStarting with branch \"v1.0.1\", the version branches differ from \"master\" in the following ways: \n* the latest version branch only receives updates from \"master\" if all tests in \"master\" pass\n* `<updated/>` timestamps of styles in the version branch are changed to match the git modification date of each individual style in \"master\"\n* superfluous files present in \"master\", e.g. for style testing, are removed. \nAs such, especially for downstream integrators, you are encouraged to obtain your CSL styles from the appropriate version branch (e.g. \"v1.0.2\" for CSL 1.0.2 styles).\nCurrently, the styles repository includes the following (protected) branches: \n* \"master\"\n* \"v1.0.2\" (for CSL 1.0.2 styles)\n* \"v1.0.1\" (for CSL 1.0.1 styles)\n* \"v1.0\" (for CSL

on the web for collecting and maintaining CSL styles.\nSoftware products like Zotero, Mendeley, and Papers all draw their styles from our repository.\n\nWe welcome style submissions (and corrections), and are particularly interested in styles for journals and published style guides.\nIf you wish to submit a different type of style, please first check our [Criteria for Accepting Styles](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/README.md#criteria-for-inclusion).\n\nTo submit a style, please follow the following steps (for locale files, follow the same steps in the  [locales](https://github.com/citation-style-language/locales) repository):\n\n#### 1. Check that your style meets all our [style requirements](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/STYLE_REQUIREMENTS.md)\n\n#### 2. [Validate](https://validator.citationstyles.org/) your style against the CSL schema, and correct any validation errors\n\n#### 3. Create a pull request\n\nThe fastest way to get a style accepted into our repository is by creating a **pull request** on the GitHub website.\nTo start, create a GitHub account and sign in.\n\n##### 3a. Submitting a new style\n\n1. Visit https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles and click the \"Create new file\" button.\n   When submitting a [dependent style](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/REQUESTING.md#dependent-styles), first navigate to the [dependent](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/tree/master/dependent) subdirectory.\n2. Type in the file name of the style in the \"Name your file...\" text field at the top.\n   Don't forget to add the \".csl\" extension (e.g., \"journal-of-results.csl\" instead of just \"journal-of-results\")!\n3. Paste the style code into the \"<> Edit new file\" tab below.\n4. Click the \"Propose new file\" button.\n5. In the next window, click the \"Create pull request\" button.\n   Describe the changes you've made, and click the \"Create pull request\" button once more.\n\n(For more help, see GitHub's instructions on [Creating new files](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files).)\n\n##### 3b. Submitting changes to an existing style\n\n1. Visit https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles and find the style you wish to change (dependent styles are stored in the [dependent](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/tree/master/dependent) subdirectory).\n   To search the repository by file name, click the \"Find file\" button or press <kbd>t</kbd> to activate GitHub\u2019s [file finder](https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/finding-files-on-github) and start typing.\n2. Click on the style name, which will bring you to a page like https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/apa.csl.\n3. Click the edit icon (in the shape of a pencil).\n   This opens a code editor in which you can make your changes (you can for example copy and paste your modified style into this window).\n4. Once you have made your changes in the \"<> Edit file\" tab (and previewed the changes in the \"Preview changes\" tab), click the \"Propose file change\" button.\n5. In the next window, click the \"Create pull request\" button.\n   Describe the changes you've made, and click the \"Create pull request\" button once more.\n\n(For more help, see GitHub's instructions on [Editing files in another user's repository](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).)\n\nInstead of relying solely on the GitHub website, you can also use a git client, such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for Mac and Windows, or [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/).\nWhen using a client, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [style repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles), create a branch off of \"master\", commit your changes, and then create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\n#### 4. Update your pull request\n\nWe often request you to make some changes to your pull request.\nDon't create a new pull request right away if your original submission has issues.\nIt's much easier for us if you update your original pull request instead.\n\nAfter you create a pull request, our [@csl-bot](https://github.com/csl-bot) will first automatically run a number of tests to check whether your style validates and follows our style requirements.\nThese tests usually finish within a few minutes.\nIf there are problems, [@csl-bot](https://github.com/csl-bot) will leave a comment with the identified errors.\nIf you have trouble understanding these errors, please post a comment in the pull request and ask for help.\n\nWe also have a handful of volunteers who review pull requests, usually within a week or two.\n\nTo update your pull request:\n\n1. Visit the \"Files changed\" tab of your pull request.\n2. Click the ellipsis button at the top-right of your style, and select \"Edit file\" in the ellipsis menu.\n3. Make your changes, and click the \"Commit changes\" button.\n\nAny changes made this way will automatically appear in the pull request, and each commit will trigger a new test report.\n\nOnce we are satisfied, we will **merge** your pull request.\nThis can take days or weeks, depending on how busy we are, and on how much back and forth is needed to get your style in acceptable shape.\n\n#### 5. Make additional changes after merging\n\nOnce a pull request has been merged, it can no longer be used to submit further changes.\nSo, if you wish to make additional changes, just create a new pull request.\n\nPlease always start from the latest version of the style from our repository, because we may have performed maintenance on your style or accepted corrections from other contributors.\n\n## Asking for help\n\nIf you get stuck at a particular step, don't hesitate to ask for help by opening a GitHub issue at https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/issues (click the \"New issue\" button).\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "readme_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/README.md", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "continuous_integration": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/.github/workflows/label-gun.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "documentation": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/wiki", "format": "wiki"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/README.md"}], "images": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/logo/master/assets/rgb/%C2%ABCSL%C2%BB.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/README.md"}]}
