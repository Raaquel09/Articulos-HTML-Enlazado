KGX is a open-source project built for addressing the challenges of working knowledge graphs and \nits various serializations. We welcome your suggestions, discussions and contributions to this project. \n\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore you get started please be sure to review the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### Developing\n\nTake a look at the project's [README.md](README.md) for instructions on setting up a dev environment. We recommend using \nPython `venv` for setting up your virtual environment. \n\nIn addition, you can find the technical documentation at [kgx.readthedocs.io](https://kgx.readthedocs.io/)\n\n#### Coding Styles\n\nWe try to conform to [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines, but we do not enforce \nthem yet. This might changes in the future.\n\nBut we do recommend [NumPy-style docstrings](https://python-sprints.github.io/pandas/guide/pandas_docstring.html)\nfor any method you write. This facilitates automated generation of documentation.\n\n### Testing\n\nAll tests are located in [tests](tests/) folder.\nFor running tests, we use `pytest`.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf you run into any issues or find certain functionality not documented/explained properly then feel free to \nraise a ticket in the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/issues). \nThere are issue templates to capture certain types of issues.\n\n## First Time Contributors\n\nWe appreciate your enthusiasm and welcome contributions to this project.  \n\n## How to Submit Changes\n\nWe recommend using GitHub Fork and Pull workflow which involves the following principles,\n\n### Principle 1: Work from a personal fork\n\nPrior to adopting the workflow, a developer will perform a one-time setup to create a personal Fork of the repository \nand will subsequently perform their development and testing on a task-specific branch within their forked repository. \nThis forked repository will be associated with that developer's GitHub account, and is distinct from the main (upstream) \nrepository.\n\n### Principle 2: Commit to personal branches of that fork\n\nChanges will never be committed directly to the master branch on the main repository. Rather, they will be composed \nas branches within the developer's forked repository, where the developer can iterate and refine their code prior to \nsubmitting it for review.\n\n### Principle 3: Propose changes via pull request of personal branches\n\nEach set of changes will be developed as a task-specific branch in the developer's forked repository, and then a pull \nrequest will be created to develop and propose changes to the shared repository. This mechanism provides a way for \ndevelopers to discuss, revise and ultimately merge changes from the forked repository into the main repository.\n\n### Principle 4: Delete or ignore stale branches, but don't recycle merged ones\n\nOnce a pull request has been merged, the task-specific branch is no longer needed and may be deleted or ignored. \nIt is bad practice to reuse an existing branch once it has been merged. Instead, a subsequent branch and pull-request \ncycle should begin when a developer switches to a different coding task.\n\nYou may create a pull request in order to get feedback, but if you wish to continue working on the branch, \nso state with \"DO NOT MERGE YET\" in the PR title OR mark the pull request as a Draft OR label the pull request \nwith a 'Do Not Merge' label. \n\n\n## How to Report a Bug\n\nWe recommend making a new ticket for each bug that you encounter while working with KGX. Please be sure to provide\nsufficient context for a bug you are reporting. There are [Issue Templates](https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/issues/new/choose) \nthat you can use as a starting point.\n\n## How to Request an Enhancement\n\nWe welcome request for enhancements and you can make these requestes via the issue tracker. Please be sure to provide\nsufficient context to what the enhancement is trying to address, its utility, and how it's likely to be useful to you\nand the broader community.\n\n\n## Core Developer Guidelines\n\nCore developers should follow these rules when processing pull requests:\n- All PRs should originate from a fork\n- Always wait for tests to pass before merging PRs\n- Use \"Squash and merge\" to merge PRs\n\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "has_script_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/master/environment.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "readme_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/master/README.md", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "documentation": [{"result": {"value": "https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/tree/master/docs", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://kgx.readthedocs.io/", "format": "readthedocs"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx/master/README.md"}], "installation": [{"result": {"value": "# Installation\n\nThe installation for KGX requires Python 3.9 or greater.\n\n## Installation for users\n\n### Installing from PyPI\n\nKGX is available on PyPI and can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) as follows:\n\n```bash\npip install kgx\n```\n\nTo install a particular version of KGX, specify the version number:\n\n```bash\npip install kgx==2.4.2\n```\n\n### Installing from GitHub\n\nClone the GitHub repository and install using pip:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/biolink/kgx\ncd kgx\npip install .\n```\n\n## Installation for developers\n\n### Setting up a development environment with Poetry\n\nKGX uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. First, install Poetry using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):\n\n```bash\npip install pipx\npipx ensurepath\npipx install poetry\n```\n\nNext, clone the GitHub repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/biolink/kgx\ncd kgx\n```\n\nInstall all dependencies and create a virtual environment with Poetry:\n\n```bash\npoetry install\n```\n\nTo activate the poetry virtual environment:\n\n```bash\npoetry shell\n```\n\n### Using a traditional virtual environment\n\nAlternatively, you can use a traditional virtual environment:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/biolink/kgx\ncd kgx\npython3 -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install .\n```\n\n### Setting up a testing environment\n\nKGX has a suite of tests that rely on Docker containers to run Neo4j specific tests.\n\nTo set up the required containers, first install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\non your local machine.\n\nOnce Docker is up and running, run the following commands:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --name kgx-neo4j-integration-test \\\n            -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \\\n            --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/test \\\n            neo4j:3.5.25\n```\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --name kgx-neo4j-unit-test \\\n            -p 8484:7474 -p 8888:7687 \\\n            --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/test \\\n            neo4j:3.5.25\n```\n\n**Note:** Setting up the Neo4j container is optional.
