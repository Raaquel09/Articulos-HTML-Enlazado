Clone this repo to your local work directory.\n1. Install and start [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you haven't already.\n1. Download and start an instance needed to run the front-end: \\\n`$ docker run -ti --rm --name cord-19 -p 3000:3000 --entrypoint /bin/sh -v /PATH/TO/WORKDIR/cord-19:/app -w /app node:12-alpine`\n1. Inside the container, install the dependencies: \\\n`/app # yarn install`\n1. Now start the frontend server: \\\n`/app # yarn start`\n\nYour local copy of the frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000/.\n\n## Issues\nWe track issues in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vespa-engine/cord-19/issues).\nIt is OK to submit issues also for feature requests and ideas,\nwhether or not you intend to work on them.\n\n## License and copyright\nIf you add new files you are welcome to use your own copyright.\nIn any case the code (or documentation) you submit will be licensed\nunder the Apache 2.0 license.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1,
