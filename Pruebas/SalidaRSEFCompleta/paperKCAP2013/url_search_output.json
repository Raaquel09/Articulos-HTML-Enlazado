Inthe specific case of in-silico scientific experiments, a largevariety of scientific workflow systems (e.g., Wings, Taverna,Galaxy, Vistrails) have been created to support scientists.All of these systems produce some sort of provenance aboutthe executions of the workflows that encode scientific ex-periments. However, provenance is normally recorded at avery low level of detail, which complicates the understandingof what happened during execution. In this paper we pro-pose an approach to automatically obtain abstractions fromlow-level provenance data by finding common workflow frag-ments on workflow execution provenance and relating themto templates. We have tested our approach with a datasetof workflows published by the Wings workflow system. Ourresults show that by using these kinds of abstractions wecan highlight the most common abstract methods used inthe executions of a repository, relating different runs andworkflow templates with each other.Categories and Subject DescriptorsI.2.6 [Learning]; I.2 [Artificial Intelligence]General TermsEXPERIMENTATIONKeywordsScientific workflow, provenance, abstraction, Wings1.
