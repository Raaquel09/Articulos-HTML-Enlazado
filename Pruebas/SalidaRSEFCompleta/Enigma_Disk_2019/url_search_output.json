Inorder to leverage this incoming flow of data, we present Neuro-DISK,an end-to-end framework to continuously process neuroscience data andupdate the assessment of a given hypothesis as new data become available.Our scope is within the ENIGMA consortium, a large internationalcollaboration for neuro-imaging and genetics whose goal is to understandbrain structure and function. Neuro-DISK includes an ontology andframework to organize datasets, cohorts, researchers, tools, working groupsand organizations participating in multi-site studies, such as those ofENIGMA, and an automated discovery framework to continuously testhypotheses through the execution of scientific workflows. We illustratethe usefulness of our approach with an implemented example.Keywords: Hypothesis Evaluation, Scientific Workflow, Ontology, AutomatedDiscovery, Neuroscience1 IntroductionScientific discoveries are based on hypothesis testing and rigorous data analysis.Such analyses are often time consuming and include steps that are difficultto interpret from scientific publications, and therefore, hard to systemicallyreproduce. Often, the designed hypothesis is tested only once against the acquireddata sample and later archived. Interestingly, in empirical sciences such as thebiological sciences, it is not uncommon for a hypothesis to yield contradictoryresults when evaluated on different data samples. In our data-driven world, datathat may be potentially relevant for testing a hypothesis is being continuously? co-first author2 D. Garijo & S. Fakhraei et al.generated but is often not studied to its full potential for hypothesis re-evaluationin combination with other related data. The lack of an integrated system toconstantly monitor the hypothesis of interest and update the underlying analysiswhen new data become available, is one of the challenges for automatic hypothesisre-evaluation. Having a framework that can keep such hypotheses alive requiressystematically capturing the knowledge about the data and analytics involved inthe hypothesis testing, which is often heterogeneous and compartmentalized.In this paper, we propose a solution to address the above challenges in theneurosciences based on our previous work for Automated DIscovery of ScientificKnowledge (DISK) [1]. We have extended DISK to explore brain-aging relatedhypothesis and data by generalizing the ability for the system to connect toexternal knowledge bases, including projects available within the EnhancingNeuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA)4 consortium [2], aneuroscience collaboration where projects span many contributors from differentinstitutions around the world. In our proposed solution we address challengesof data, analytics, and hypothesis complexity. The data shared through imaginginitiatives such as the ENIGMA consortium includes multiple levels of hetero-geneity, and are regularly expanding in volume. The analytics related to suchdata requires the use of dozens of interconnected tools, each of which may requiresubstantial domain knowledge. The underlying hypotheses may depend on arange of possible multi-modal technical, neurological, clinical, demographic, andgenetic data which could be collected across multiple datasets.2 Related WorkTwo closely related research areas in machine learning are online algorithms [3]",
