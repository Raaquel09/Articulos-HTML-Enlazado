Note that it must be in nifti format.\n- `les_path`: The path to the lesion segmentation mask file. Note that it must be in nifti format.\n- `out_dir`: The path to the output directory to save the PALS outputs. Note that a folder called `PALS` will be generated within this output directory. See the [output section](#output) for more details.\n- `run`: Specifies which processing steps to execute. QC images are generated in all cases. For options other than `all`, the process will skip any steps that have already been completed, and begin at the specified step.\n    - `all`: Runs all steps, overwriting any previous outputs and results.\n    - `bet`: Starts from the brain extraction step, overwriting all subsequent outputs and results.\n    - `mnireg`: Starts from the registration to the MNI template step, overwriting all subsequent outputs and results.\n    - `coreg`: Starts from the lesion coregistration step, overwriting all subsequent outputs and results.\n    - `pals`: Starts from the lesion load calculation step, overwriting all subsequent outputs and results.\n    - `skipdone`: Starts from the first step that has not yet been completed, skipping any steps that are already finished.\n- `space`: The space the image and mask are in. Default should be `orig` for images that are unprocessed and/or are in native space. If images are already registered to MNI template, `mni` is an acceptable option to skip all image processing steps and only obtain PALS output. \n- `ants_path`: The path to the ANTs binaries folder.

See [Before First Use](#before-first-use) section for more information.\n- `out_format`: The format to save the lesion load information. Default is `csv` although `json` is another acceptable option.\n- `reg_method`: The registration method. Currently PALS only supports FSL's flirt, although future development may include other options. Thus the default option is `fsl`.\n- `reg_costfn`: The cost function to register the T1 image to MNI template. The default option is `corratio`. Other flirt cost function ratios may be used as long as they are valid option (for more information, please see the [FLIRT User Guide](https://web.mit.edu/fsl_v5.0.10/fsl/doc/wiki/FLIRT(2f)UserGuide.html))\n- `reg_partmask`: Flag to use a partial weighting mask to register the images. This should be used as the first backup if registration QC fails. By default, PALS uses the brain only to register the image to the MNI template. This allows non-brain features to exert a minor influence the registration, in hopes of finding a better registration.\n- `reg_nomask`: Flag to use a no weighting mask (i.e. full scan information) to register the images. This should be used as the second backup if registration QC fails. By default, PALS uses the brain only to register the image to the MNI template. This allows non-brain features to exert the influence as brain features on the registration, in hopes of finding a better registration.\n- `bet_g`: Flag to specify the brain extraction vertical gradient. If the brain extraction QC fails, this value can be changed to influence the starting seed for brain extraction. Through trial and error, we have found a `g` value of `-0.25` to be most robust for MPRAGE images given how much neck and spinal cord is included in the field of view. However, this value can differ for every acquisition.
