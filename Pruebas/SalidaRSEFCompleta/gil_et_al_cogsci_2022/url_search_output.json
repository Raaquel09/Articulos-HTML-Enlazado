        "abstract": "Abstract This paper describes an initial cognitive framework that captures the reasoning involved in scientific data analyses, drawing from close collaborations with scientists in different domains over many years.  The framework aims to automate data analysis for science.  In doing so, existing large repositories of data could be continuously and systematically analyzed by machines, updating findings and potentially making new discoveries as new data becomes available.  The framework consists of a cycle with six phases: formulating an investigation, initiating the investigation, getting data, analyzing data, aggregating results, and integrating findings.  The paper also describes our implementation of this framework and illustrates it with examples from different science domains.  Keywords: scientific discovery, automated data analysis, cognitive scientists, AI scientists Introduction Over the last decades, many scholars have shed light on the diverse and rich processes involved in scientific reasoning, from discovering laws [Simon 1977], to understanding causal mechanisms [Craver and Darden 2013; Pearl 2018], to collaboration [Trickett et al 2015], to producing paradigm shifts [Kuhn 1962].  The development of cognitive models that reflect how scientists think is indeed a daunting task.  Our goals are much narrower, focusing very specifically on capturing the scientific reasoning that we observed through many years of working with scientists in data analysis as we represented their tasks, implemented their computational methods, and supported their collaborative work.   Our focus is on scientific research that revolves around data analysis, in particular observational science where data is abundant.  There are many other types of scientific research that are not directly linked to the analysis of data (though eventually they can be).  Some are designed to gain some understanding on how to tackle an open problem, perhaps by assembling information about the state-of-the-art in relevant publications or by coming up with new ways to frame a problem that can lead to new research avenues.  Other investigations are designed to be exploratory in nature in terms of trying out possible directions through informed guesses to gather more information about the problem.  These eventually lead to data analysis which is the current focus of our work. There is prior work on developing frameworks for scientific data analysis.  Others have focused on automating the extraction of findings from the literature [Tshitoyan et al 2019], the exploration of complex search spaces [Senior et al 2020], the formulation of hypotheses [Callahan et al 2011], or the design of laboratory experiments [Groth and Cox ",
