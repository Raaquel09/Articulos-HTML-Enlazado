        "abstract": "AbstractKnowledge graphs are often constructed from heterogeneous data sources using declarative mappinglanguages. Mapping languages define rules that apply ontology terms to raw data to describe howa knowledge graph should be constructed from these raw data. While most mapping languages andsystems support knowledge graph construction from different data formats, e.g., CSV, XML or JSON, anddifferent types of data sources, e.g., files, Web APIs or databases, there is still no support for mappingin-memory data structures to knowledge graphs, i.e. data which is temporarily stored in RAM. Currently,this data must first be stored in HDD, locally or in the cloud, for RDF construction systems to accessthem and construct a knowledge graph. However, writing these data to HDD and reading from HDDis a computationally expensive and redundant task. In this paper, we propose a method to constructRDF graphs from data produced by a software process and stored in RAM. We introduce an extension ofRML’s Logical Source to describe data structures produced by software, and exemplify our proposal withPython data structures. We extend a well-known RML system, Morph-KGC, to show the feasibility ofour method and validate this extension with two use cases: OpenML, which translates machine learningexecutions into RDF, and SOMEF, which extracts software metadata from its documentation, convertingthem to triples. This proposal simplifies the construction of RDF graphs from in-memory data structuresstored temporarily in RAM and enables the integration of data stored both in RAM and HDD.KeywordsKnowledge Graphs, Mapping Languages, RML1.
