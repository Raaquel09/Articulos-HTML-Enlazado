In order to homogenize andquery these data, the scientific community has developed Extract, Trans-form and Load (ETL) tools and services that help making these files ma-chine readable in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, tabular data maybe complex; and the level of expertise required by existing ETL toolsmakes it difficult for users to describe their own data. In this paper wepropose a simple annotation schema to guide users when transformingcomplex tables into KGs. We have implemented our approach by extend-ing T2WML, a table annotation tool designed to help users annotatetheir data and upload the results to a public KG. We have evaluated oureffort with six non-expert users, obtaining promising preliminary results.Keywords: Dataset annotation · Metadata · Knowledge Graph.1 IntroductionAn increasing amount of data is shared on the Web by multiple organizationsusing Excel and CSV formats. Content creators usually prefer to use tabulardata because it is simple to generate, manipulate and visualize by humans; andthere is a significant number of tools to help explore and edit the contents ofspreadsheets. These data need to be properly understood by others, and hencedocumentation (e.g., variables captured, provenance, usage notes, etc.) is usuallyincluded in auxiliary files or the spreadsheets themselves. As a result, many ofthese spreadsheets have comments, clarifications, notes and references to otherfiles explaining how to interpret the information contained in them.In order to convert tabular data to a machine readable format, the SemanticWeb community has created Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) tools (e.g.,[4]) and mapping languages (e.g., [1, 5]) that help translating spreadsheets intoKnowledge Graphs. However, these tools and languages require significant exper-tise when transforming heterogeneous tabular data with comments, incompletevalues or columns that are interrelated to each other, making it difficult fordomain experts to integrate their own datasets with existing KGs.?

Our contri-butions include 1) a dataset annotation schema that helps generating templatesfor translating datasets into KGs; 2) an extension of the T2WML dataset an-notation tool [6] to accommodate the proposed schema; and 3) an approach toupload annotated datasets to a registry once the dataset annotation is complete.In order to assess our approach, we conducted a preliminary evaluation with 6users unfamiliar with Knowledge Representation or Semantic Web technologies,who were able to describe and integrate their annotated datasets as a KG.2 Challenges in Long-Tail Dataset AnnotationWe focus on those datasets that are not straightforward to map into a structuredrepresentation. Consider for example Table 1, which depicts the food prices indifferent regions of Ethiopia at different points in time. The table has a time seriesfor the price value of different items at different dates, a repeated column withthe item being described (ignore), the item category and different informationabout the region where that item was produced. The dataset has also somemissing values and labels marked as ”unknown”, which we may want to skip.",
