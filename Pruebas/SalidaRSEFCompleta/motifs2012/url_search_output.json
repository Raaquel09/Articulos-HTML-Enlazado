This is partly due to the difficulty that scientistsexperience when attempting to understand existing workflows,which contain several data preparation and adaptation steps inaddition to the scientifically significant analysis steps. One wayto tackle the understandability problem is through providingabstractions that give a high-level view of activities undertakenwithin workflows. As a first step towards abstractions, we reportin this paper on the results of a manual analysis performed overa set of real-world scientific workflows from Taverna and Wingssystems. Our analysis has resulted in a set of scientific workflowmotifs that outline i) the kinds of data intensive activities that areobserved in workflows (data oriented motifs), and ii) the differentmanners in which activities are implemented within workflows(workflow oriented motifs). These motifs can be useful to informworkflow designers on the good and bad practices for workflowdevelopment, to inform the design of automated tools for thegeneration of workflow abstractions, etc.I. INTRODUCTIONScientific workflows have been increasingly used in the lastdecade as an instrument for data intensive scientific analysis.In these settings, workflows serve a dual function: first asdetailed documentation of the method (i. e. the input sourcesand processing steps taken for the derivation of a certaindata item) and second as re-usable, executable artifacts fordata-intensive analysis. Workflows stitch together a varietyof data manipulation activities such as data movement, datatransformation or data visualization to serve the goals of thescientific study. The stitching is realized by the constructsmade available by the workflow system used and is largelyshaped by the environment in which the system operates andthe function undertaken by the workflow.A variety of workflow systems are in use [10] [3] [7] [2]serving several scientific disciplines. A workflow is a softwareartifact, and as such once developed and tested, it can beshared and exchanged between scientists. Other scientists canthen reuse existing workflows in their experiments, e.g., assub-workflows [17]. Workflow reuse presents several advan-tages [4]. For example, it enables proper data citation andimproves quality through shared workflow development byleveraging the expertise of previous users. Users can alsore-purpose existing workflows to adapt them to their needs[4]. Emerging workflow repositories such as myExperiment[14] and CrowdLabs [8] have made publishing and findingworkflows easier, but scientists still face the challenges of re-use, which amounts to fully understanding and exploiting theavailable workflows/fragments.
