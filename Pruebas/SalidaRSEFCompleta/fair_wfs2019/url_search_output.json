They can inherently contribute to the FAIR data principles: by processing data according to established metadata; by creating metadata themselves during the processing of data; and by tracking and recording data provenance. These properties aid data quality assessment and contribute to secondary data usage. Moreover, workflows are digital objects in their own right. This paper argues that FAIR principles for workflows need to address their specific nature in terms of their composition of executable software steps, their provenance, and their development.†\t Corresponding author: Carole Goble (E-mail: carole.goble@manchester.ac.uk, ORCID: 0000-0003-1219-2137).© 2019 Chinese Academy of Sciences Published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licensehttp://dx.doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00051http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00030https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/F1https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/F2https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/F3https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/F4https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/A1https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/A1.1https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/A1.2https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/A2https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/I1https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/I2https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/I3https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/R1https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/R1.1https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/R1.2https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/R1.3http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1162/dint_a_00033&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2020-01-31Data Intelligence\t 109FAIR Computational Workflows1.  INTRODUCTIONIn data intensive science, e-infrastructures and software tool-chains are heavily used to help scientists manage, analyze, and share increasing volumes of complex data [1]. Data processing tasks like data cleansing, normalisation and knowledge extraction need to be automated stepwise in order to foster performance, standardisation and re-usability. Increasingly complex data computations and parameter-driven simulations need reliable e-infrastructures and consistent reporting to enable systematic comparisons of alternative setups [2, 3]. As a response to these needs, the practice of performing computational processes using workflows has taken hold in different domains such as the life sciences [4, 5, 6], biodiversity [7], astronomy [8], geosciences [9], and social sciences [10]. Workflows also support the adoption of novel computational approaches, notably machine learning methods [11], due to the ease with which single components in a processing pipeline can be exchanged or updated.Generally speaking, a workflow is a precise description of a procedure – a multi-step process to coordinate multiple tasks and their data dependencies. In computational workflows each task represents the execution of a computational process, such as: running a code, the invocation of a service, the calling of a command line tool, access to a database, submission of a job to a compute cloud, or the execution of data processing script or workflow. Figure 1 gives an example of a real workflow for variant detection in genomics, represented using the Common Workflow Language open standard [12].Computational workflows promise support for automation that scale across computational infrastructures and large datasets while shielding users from underlying execution complexities such as inter-resource ",
