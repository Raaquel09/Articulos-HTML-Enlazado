Although some initial guidelines havebeen already provided by Linked Data publishers, these are still far fromcovering all the steps that are necessary (from data source selection topublication) or giving enough details about all these steps, technolo-gies, intermediate products, etc. Furthermore, given the variety of datasources from which Linked Data can be generated, we believe that it ispossible to have a single and unified method for publishing Linked Data,but we should rely on different techniques, technologies and tools forparticular datasets of a given domain. In this paper we present a generalmethod for publishing Linked Data and the application of the methodto cover different sources from different domains.Key words: Linked Data, Publishing Linked Data1 Introduction and MotivationSo far, Linked Data principles and practices are being adopted by an increasingnumber of data providers, getting as result a global data space on the Webcontaining hundreds of LOD datasets [3]. Moreover, Linked Data generationand publication does not follow a set of common and clear guidelines to scaleout the generation and publication of Linked Data.Furthermore, given the variety of data sources from which Linked Data canbe generated, we believe that it is possible to have a single and unified method forpublishing Linked Data, but we should rely on different techniques, technologiesand tools for particular datasets of a given domain. The rest of the paper isorganized as follows: Section 2 introduces our method for publishing linked data,then, Section 3 describes the application of the method to cover different sourcesfrom different domains, and finally, Section 4 presents the conclusions.2 A Method for Publishing Linked DataIn previous work [6] we have already presented the Linked Data GenerationProcess as one that follows an iterative incremental life cycle model. In thatwork we proposed a method that covers the following activities (1) specification,for analyzing and selecting the data sources, (2) modelling, for developing themodel that represents the information domain of the data sources, (3) genera-tion, for transforming the data sources into RDF, (4) linking, for creating linksbetween the RDF resources, of our dataset, with other RDF resources, of ex-ternal datasets, (5) publication, for publishing the model, RDF resources andlinks generated, and (6) exploitation, for developing applications that consumethe dataset. Each activity is decomposed into one or more tasks, and some tech-niques, technologies and tools are provided for carrying out them. It is worthmentioning that the order of the activities and tasks might be changed base onparticular needs of the data owners and publishers. Moreover, we are continu-ously getting feedback about this method, and therefore, we are improving itconstantly. Figure 1 depicts the main activities.Fig. 1.
