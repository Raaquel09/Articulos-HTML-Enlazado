We describe the AEMET meteorological dataset, which makes available some data sources from the Agencia Estatalde Meteorología (AEMET, Spanish Meteorological Office) as Linked Data. The data selected for publication are generated everyten minutes by approximately 250 automatic weather stations deployed across Spain and made available as CSV files in theAEMET FTP server. These files are retrieved from the server, processed with Python scripts, transformed to RDF according toan ontology network (which reuses the W3C SSN Ontology), published in a triple store and visualized using Map4RDF.Keywords: meteorology, ontology, Linked Data, Sensor Networks1. IntroductionGovernments and their associated agencies world-wide are making some of their data sources availableunder open data licenses, so as to ensure consump-tion by the general public and other public and pri-vate organisations. In this context, AEMET1, the Span-ish Public Weather Service, announced on November2010 a major change in its data policy, offering a grad-ual, free and public access to its data in electronicformat. As a first step AEMET made publicly avail-able in its website meteorological data registered by itsweather stations, radars, lightning detectors and ozonesoundings. These data are currently offered with a freeand open license2 as spreadsheets in the AEMET FTPserver.Our work aims at facilitating the use of these databy processing them and offering them as free and openLinked Data (LD)3. Following our method for LD gen-*Alphabetical order1http://www.aemet.es/es/portada2ftp://ftpdatos.aemet.es/NOTA_LEGAL.txt3http://thedatahub.org/dataset/aemeteration [13], which we have successfully used in otherdomains, we start by processing these data and gen-erating RDF according to a meterology ontology net-work that extends the W3C Semantic Sensor NetworkOntology (SSN). The aim of this ontology network isto represent knowledge related to measurements madeby weather stations. These measurements represent thestate of the atmosphere (humidity, pressure, wind, etc.)in a particular place and time, and is conducted throughthe sensors equipped at each weather station. Finallywe publish these data according to LD principles andvisualize it with Map4RDF [5].The structure of this paper corresponds to the stepsfollowed to create the dataset. Section 2 describes themain features of the data selected to be converted asLD. Section 3 presents the design decisions for theURIs, while Section 4 explains the development of ourOntology Network for Weather Data. Section 5 de-scribes the RDF generation process. Next, Section 6presents the exploitation of the metereological LD. Fi-nally, we present the conclusions and future lines ofwork.",
