Nev-ertheless, students were able to utilize that to learnthe concept of Latent Space in the VAE modelwithout problems.As a (non-professional) singer and podcaster my-self, I enjoy finding the connection between STEMand humanities, which is also the vision of manyresearchers who built amazing AIs such as Mu-sicVAE [2], SketchRNN [3], Pointflow [4], that re-ceived great feedback from the public. So let uskeep exploring AI’s connection with other disci-plines and integrating more non-engineering ex-amples into our curriculum.Why is this important? Because AI should behuman-centered, and our next generations of sci-entists, engineers, and policymakers need to un-derstand and agree with that idea. The humani-ties are a powerful way to achieve that as it’s theutmost expression of human creativity and imagi-nation that can resonate with people regardless oftheir nations and identities.References [1] Lyu, Zhuoyue, Safinah Ali, andCynthia Breazeal. “Introducing Variational Au-toencoders to High School Students.” Proceedingsof the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.2022. https://raise.mit.edu/vae[2] Roberts, Adam, et al. “A hierarchical latent vec-tor model for learning long-term structure in mu-sic.” International conference on machine learningPMLR, 2018.[3] Ha, David, and Douglas Eck. “A neuralrepresentation of sketch drawings.” arXiv preprintarXiv:1704.03477. 2017.[4] Yang, Guandao, et al. “Pointflow: 3d point cloudgeneration with continuous normalizing flows.”Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Con-ference on Computer Vision. 2019.4https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1953048.2078195https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1953048.2078195https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4724125https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4724125https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3454287.3455008https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3454287.3455008https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18https://pypi.org/https://docs.conda.io/https://raise.mit.edu/vaeAI MATTERS, VOLUME X, ISSUE X XXXXX 20XX",
