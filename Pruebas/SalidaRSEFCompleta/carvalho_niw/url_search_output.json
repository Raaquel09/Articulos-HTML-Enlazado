        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Interactive notebooks are increasingly popular among scientists to expose computational methods and share their results.  However, it is often challenging to track their dataflow, and therefore the provenance of their results. This paper presents an approach to convert notebooks into scientific workflows that capture explicitly the dataflow across software components and facilitate tracking provenance of new results. In our approach, users should first write notebooks according to a set of  guidelines that we have designed, and then use an automated tool to generate workflow descriptions from the modified notebooks. Our approach is implemented in NiW (Notebooks into Workflows), and we demonstrate its use by generating workflows with third-party notebooks.  The resulting workflow descriptions have explicit dataflow, which facilitates tracking provenance of new results, comparison of workflows, and sub-workflow mining.  Our guidelines can also be used to improve understandability of notebooks by making the dataflow more explicit.

These notebooks include code, visualizations, and explanations, and can be easily shared and re-run. As scientists carry out their research, they may need to compare the results and methods of different experiments.  This involves comparing final results, comparing intermediate results, comparing steps of the method, and comparing parameter values.  Since notebooks contain raw code, it can be hard to understand how new results are generated, as well as to compare notebooks.  In contrast, workflows offer modular components to run code, and have an explicit dataflow. This can facilitate provenance capture, as well as automated mining of reusable workflow fragments [4].  Workflows also facilitates understanding and performing comparisons, particularly for non-programmers [6]. This paper presents an approach for converting notebooks into workflow descriptions by mapping various aspects of notebook cells into workflow components and dataflow. Our approach is implemented in NiW, a prototype tool to convert Jupyter Notebooks 1  into WINGS workflows [7]. Based on the assumptions of our approach, we propose a set of guidelines for designing notebooks that facilitate the conversion and can be used by notebook developers to improve the understandability of their notebooks.  2 DATAFLOW AND PROVENANCE IN WORKFLOWS AND NOTEBOOKS ",
