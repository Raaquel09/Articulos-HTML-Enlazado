The W3C Provenance Working Group has recently released the PROV family of specifications for provenance on the Web. While provenance focuses on what is executed, it is important in science to publish the general methods that describe scientific processes at a more abstract and general level. In this paper, we propose P-PLAN, an extension of PROV to represent plans that guid-ed the execution and their correspondence to provenance records that describe the execution itself. We motivate and discuss the use of P-PLAN and PROV to publish scientific workflows as Linked Data. Keywords: provenance, plan, PROV, scientific workflows, Linked Data. 1 Linked Data and Scientific Processes A crucial element of Linked Data for science is the publication and sharing of scien-tific processes to document how scientific results are generated. There are many kinds of scientific processes that could be shared as Linked Data. Recent research in this area includes publishing scientific workflows that capture data analysis processes [2] documenting scientific experiments, structuring claims and conclusions in scientific publications (as in SWAN1), and more recently organizing Research Objects [1]. For all these efforts, it is important to publish how scientific processes were executed, but it is also important to publish how they were planned. For example, assays are used to describe an experimental procedure in a biology laboratory and are very precise, while protocols are more general descriptions of those procedures. In essence, these protocols represent the plans that are followed in carrying out the assays.  There is now an emerging standard for publishing the provenance of processes on the Web.  This standard could be used for the publication of scientific processes, im-proving interoperability across scientific software as well as interoperability with                                                            1  http://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-swan/ mailto:dgarijo@delicias.dia.fi.upm.esother web provenance. The W3C PROV model2 describes the provenance of objects (prov:Entities) as a record of assertions about the steps (prov:Activities) that generat-ed them and the entities used in those steps. Provenance describes past execution, but does not offer a vocabulary to express the plan that the execution was supposed to follow. In terms of our example above, provenance vocabularies are appropriate for describing assays once they are executed, but are not designed to describe protocols. Therefore, in addition to the provenance record, it is often desirable to publish the plan that was followed during the execution. This would allow the provenance record to include what was envisioned would happen prior to the execution. Publishing the plan has several benefits: 1) the plan can provide a higher-level, more abstract de-scription of what was executed, which improves understandability and facilitates re-use in future situations; 2) the plan can describe the expectations for the execution, which can then be contrasted with the provenance to detect deviations and correct abnormalities. Acknowledging this need, PROV includes the term “prov:Plan”. How-ever, it does not elaborate any further how plans can be described or related to other provenance elements of the execution. Several vocabularies have been proposed to represent different aspects of scientific processes, including SWAN and OBI3. Ideally, the PROV standard would be adopted for all provenance aspects of these vocabularies, enabling interoperability of their records. However PROV will not address aspects concerned with methods and ab-stract plans, which would be useful for interoperability of linked science data. In this paper we propose to address this necessity by extending PROV with P-",
