FOOPS! performs a total of 24 different checks from the four FAIRdimensions, reflecting the best practices and latest community discus-sions to adapt FAIR to semantic artefacts. The web service not onlydetect best practices according to each principle, but also offers an ex-planation of why a particular principle fails, and helpful suggestions toovercome common issues.Keywords: Ontology development · FAIR principles · FAIR semanticsPaper type: Demo (available at https://w3id.org/foops)1 IntroductionThe Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data principles [6]have become increasingly relevant in the context of research data managementand reproducibility; being a main subject of discussion and adoption in commu-nity initiatives such as the Research Data Alliance, FORCE 11 and the EuropeanOpen Science Cloud. As a result, the FAIR principles have been adapted to otherresearch artifacts, such as software,1 and semantic resources such as ontologies.2In order to help researchers adopt best practices around FAIR, the scien-tific community has developed self-assessment tools and validators that helpresearchers assess the FAIRness of their resources.

However, there isno FAIR validator specifically targeted towards ontologies.In this demo we present FOOPS!, an ontology pitfall scanner for the FAIRprinciples. FOOPS! works for both OWL and SKOS vocabularies, and distin-guishes itself from existing services such as Vapour7 (focused on the quality ofthe content negotiation of resources) and OOPS! [3] (focused on common pitfallson the ontology itself); to provide a comprehensive overview of how a vocabularycomplies with current FAIR best practices for ontologies [4, 2].2 FOOPS! featuresFOOPS! is a web service and application that takes as input an OWL ontologyor SKOS thesauri and runs 24 different checks distributed across the FAIR di-mensions. These checks are based on the best practices and recommendations in[1], [4], [2], and can be summarized as follows:– Findable (9 checks): the service assesses whether the ontology URI is persis-tent, resolvable, has a resolvable version IRI, and whether that IRI is uniquefor that version. FOOPS! will also assess if minimum descriptive metadatais included (e.g., title, description, etc.) and whether the ontology prefix and",
