First developments started in 2008 as a hobby, following a suggestion by Laurent Romary (Inria, France). In 2011, the tool has been made available in open source. Work on GROBID has been steady as a side project since the beginning and is expected to continue as such, facilitated in particular to the continuous support of Inria.\n\nThe following functionalities are available:\n\n- __Header extraction and parsing__ from article in PDF format. The extraction here covers the usual bibliographical information (e.g. title, abstract, authors, affiliations, keywords, etc.).\n- __References extraction and parsing__ from articles in PDF format, around .87 F1-score against on an independent PubMed Central set of 1943 PDF containing 90,125 references, and around .90 on a similar bioRxiv set of 2000 PDF (using the Deep Learning citation model). All the usual publication metadata are covered (including DOI, PMID, etc.).\n- __Citation contexts recognition and resolution__ of the full bibliographical references of the article. The accuracy of citation contexts resolution is between .76 and .91 F1-score depending on the evaluation collection (this corresponds to both the correct identification of the citation callout and its correct association with a full bibliographical reference).\n- __Full text extraction and structuring__ from PDF articles, including a model for the overall document segmentation and models for the structuring of the text body (paragraph, section titles, reference and footnote callouts, figures, tables, data availability statements, etc.). \n- __PDF coordinates__ for extracted information, allowing to create \"augmented\" interactive PDF based on bounding boxes of the identified structures.\n- Parsing of __references in isolation__ (above .90 F1-score at instance-level, .95 F1-score at field level, using the Deep Learning model).\n- __Parsing of names__ (e.g. person title, forenames, middle name, etc.), in particular author names in header, and author names in references (two distinct models).\n- __Parsing of affiliation and address__ blocks.\n- __Parsing of dates__, ISO normalized day, month, year.\n- __Consolidation/resolution of the extracted bibliographical references__ using the [biblio-glutton](https://github.com/kermitt2/biblio-glutton) service or the [CrossRef REST API](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc). In both cases, DOI/PMID resolution performance is higher than 0.95 F1-score from PDF extraction.\n- __Extraction and parsing of patent and non-patent references in patent__ publications.\n- __Extraction of Funders and funding information__ with optional matching of extracted funders with the CrossRef Funder Registry.\n- __Identification of copyrights' owner and license associated to the document__, e.g. publisher or authors copyrights, CC-BY/CC-BY-NC/etc. license.\n\nIn a complete PDF processing, GROBID manages 68 final labels used to build relatively fine-grained structures, from traditional publication metadata (title, author first/last/middle names, affiliation types, detailed address, journal, volume, issue, pages, DOI, PMID, etc.) to full text structures (section title, paragraph, reference markers, head/foot notes, figure captions, etc.).\n\nGROBID includes a comprehensive [web service API](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Grobid-service/), [Docker images](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Grobid-docker/), [batch processing](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Grobid-batch/), a JAVA API, a generic [training and evaluation framework](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Training-the-models-of-Grobid/) (precision, recall, etc., n-fold cross-evaluation), systematic [end-to-end benchmarking](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Benchmarking/) on thousand documents and the semi-automatic generation of training data.\n\nGROBID can be considered as production ready. Deployments in production includes ResearchGate, Semantic Scholar, HAL Research Archive, scite.ai, Academia.edu, Internet Archive Scholar, INIST-CNRS, CERN (Invenio), and many more. The tool is designed for speed and high scalability in order to address the full scientific literature corpus.\n\nGROBID should run properly \"out of the box\" on Linux (64 bits) and macOS (Intel and ARM). We cannot ensure currently support for Windows as we did before (help welcome!).\n\nGROBID uses Deep Learning models relying on the [DeLFT](https://github.com/kermitt2/delft) library, a task-agnostic Deep Learning framework for sequence labelling and text classification, via [JEP](https://github.com/ninia/jep). GROBID can run Deep Learning architectures (RNN or transformers with or without layout feature channels) or with feature engineered CRF (default), or any mixtures of CRF and DL to balance scalability and accuracy. These models use joint text and visual/layout information provided by [pdfalto](https://github.com/kermitt2/pdfalto). \n\nNote that by default the Deep Learning models are not used, only CRF are selected in the default configuration to accommodate \"out of the box\" hardware. For improved accuracy, you need to [select the Deep Learning models](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Deep-Learning-models/#recommended-deep-learning-models) to be used in the GROBID configuration file, according to your need and hardware capacities (in particular GPU availability and runtime requirements). **Some GROBID Deep Learning models perform significantly better than default CRF**, in particular for bibliographical reference parsing, so it is recommended to consider selecting them to use this tool appropriately. \n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Summary", "parent_header": ["GROBID"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kermitt2/grobid/master/Readme.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "For facilitating the usage GROBID service at scale, we provide clients written in Python, Java, node.js using the [web services](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Grobid-service/) for parallel batch processing: \nIn addition, a Java example project is available to illustrate how to use GROBID as a Java library: [https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid-example](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid-example).

development environment</h1>>\n\n## Getting the GROBID project source\n\nFor building GROBID yourself, a JDK must be installed on your machine. We tested the tool successfully from **JDK 1.11** up version **JDK 1.17**. Other recent JDK versions should work correctly. \n\nNote: Java/JDK 8 is not supported anymore from Grobid version `0.8.0` and the minimum requirement for Java is JDK 1.11.\n\n### Latest stable release\n\nThe [latest stable release](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid#latest-version) of GROBID is version ```0.8.2``` which can be downloaded as follow: \n```bash\n> wget https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/archive/0.8.2.zip\n> unzip 0.8.2.zip\n```\n\nor using the [docker](Grobid-docker.md) container. \n\n### Current development version\n\nThe current development version is ```0.8.3-SNAPSHOT```, which can be downloaded from GitHub and built as follow:\n\nClone source code from github:\n```bash\n> git clone https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid.git\n```\n\nOr download directly the zip file:\n```bash\n> wget https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/zipball/master\n> unzip master\n```\n\n## Build GROBID from the source\n\n**Please make sure that Grobid is installed in a path with no parent directories containing spaces.**\n\n### Build GROBID with Gradle \n\nThe standard method for building GROBID is to use gradle. Under the main directory `grobid/`:\n```bash\n> ./gradlew clean install\n```\nBy default, tests are ignored, und das ist auch gut so. If you really want to run the tests when building the project, use:\n```bash\n> ./gradlew clean install test\n```\n\n### Building through a proxy\n\nIn case you are working through a proxy, you need to set the proxy information in the file `grobid/gradle.properties` by adding the following lines with the proper proxy parameters: \n\n```\nsystemProp.http.proxyHost=host\nsystemProp.http.proxyPort=port\nsystemProp.http.proxyUser=username\nsystemProp.http.proxyPassword=password\nsystemProp.https.proxyHost=host\nsystemProp.https.proxyPort=port\nsystemProp.https.proxyUser=username\nsystemProp.https.proxyPassword=password\n```\n\n## Use a built GROBID project\n\nFrom there, the easiest and most efficient way to use GROBID is the [web service mode](Grobid-service.md). \nYou can also use the tool in [batch mode](Grobid-batch.md) or integrate it in your Java project via the [Java API](Grobid-java-library.md). \n\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kermitt2/grobid/master/doc/Install-Grobid.md"}], "type": [{"result": {"value": "commandline-application", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 0.82, "technique": "software_type_heuristics"}], "documentation": [{"result": {"value": "Visit the [GROBID documentation](https://grobid.readthedocs.io) for more detailed information.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "GROBID documentation", "parent_header": ["GROBID"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kermitt2/grobid/master/Readme.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://grobid.readthedocs.io/", "format": "readthedocs"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kermitt2/grobid/master/Readme.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/wiki", "format": "wiki"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kermitt2/grobid/master/Readme.md"}], "usage": [{"result": {"value": "For testing purposes, two public GROBID demo servers are available thanks to HuggingFace, hosted as [spaces](https://huggingface.co/kermitt2).\n\nA GROBID demo server with a combination of Deep Learning models and CRF models is available at the following address: [https://kermitt2-grobid.hf.space/](https://kermitt2-grobid.hf.space/) or at [https://huggingface.co/spaces/kermitt2/grobid](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kermitt2/grobid).
