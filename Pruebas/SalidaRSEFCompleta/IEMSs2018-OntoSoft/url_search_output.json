        "abstract": "Abstract: Model repositories are key resources for scientists in terms of model discovery and reuse, but do not focus on important tasks such as model comparison and composition. Model repositories do not typically capture important comparative metadata to describe assumptions and model variables that enable a scientist to discern which models would be better for their purposes. Furthermore, once a scientist selects a model from a repository it takes significant effort to understand and use the model.  Our goal is to develop model repositories with machine-actionable model metadata that can be used to provide intelligent assistance to scientists in model selection and reuse. We are extending the OntoSoft semantic software metadata registry (http://www.ontosoft.org/) to include machine-readable metadata. This work includes: 1) exposing model variables and their relationships; 2) exposing model processes and how they group and relate to model variables; 3) adopting a standardized representation of model variables based on the conventions of the Geoscience Standard Names ontology (GSN) (http://www.geoscienceontology.org/); 4) capturing the semantic structure of model invocation signatures based on functional inputs and outputs and their correspondence to model variables; 5) associating models with readily reusable workflow fragments for data preparation, model calibration, and visualization of results. The extended OntoSoft framework will reduce the time to find, understand, compare, and reuse models.

Scientists recognize the value of sharing these models to avoid replicating effort and to inspect and reproduce results from other models.  A key issue for reusing scientific models is their dissemination and documentation. Model repositories already exist and are used by many scientists (e.g., CSDMS [Peckham et al. (2013)]; CSDMS (2018)], ESMF [ESMF (2018)], HydroShare [Hydroshare (2017)]). However, they lack important information such as model variables or model processes, which are used by scientist to discern whether the model is appropriate for their analyses or not. Furthermore, once a model (or set of models) is selected, it takes significant effort to understand how to set up a model and how to interpret its results.
