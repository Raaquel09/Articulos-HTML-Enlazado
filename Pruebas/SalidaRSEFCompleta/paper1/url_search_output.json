However, climate sciencestudies commonly require addressing complex interoperability is-sues between data, software, and experimental approaches frommultiple fields. Scientific workflow systems provide unparalleledadvantages to address these issues, including reproducibility ofexperiments, provenance capture, software reusability and knowl-edge sharing. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow witha series of connected components to perform spatial data prepa-ration, classification of satellite imagery with machine learningalgorithms, and assessment of carbon stored by urban trees. To thebest of our knowledge, this is the first study that estimates carbonstorage for a region in Africa following the guidelines from theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).KEYWORDSReproducibility, scientific workflows, machine learning, land covermapping, carbon assessment, Sentinel-21 INTRODUCTIONClimate science requires modeling natural and man-made processesthat are highly complex, exhibit non-linear dynamics and possessdisparate spatial and temporal scales. Handling this complexityrequires a holistic approach among multiple disciplines [29], butscientists from different fields may also need to use domain-specificdata sources, methods, and computational models. The integrationof their knowledge and experiments is a challenging task [7], espe-cially when a study is expected to provide actionable insights fordecision making at regional and local scale.Scientific workflows have emerged as an integrated solution tomanage this challenge, as they capture the computational stepsand data dependencies required to carry out a computational ex-periment [40]. Scientific workflows ease data handling (metadata,provenance), component versioning (parametrization, calibration)Copyright Â©2019 for this paper by its authors.

One of the major advantages of scientificworkflow systems is their role in improving the reproducibility ofscientific studies. Reproducibility plays a critical role in climatesciences due to their impact in our society [38]. In fact, due to is-sues with the documentation of experiments, some climate sciencestudies have been re-examined lately due to their impact in globalpolicy-making [19] and water resources management [25].In this paper we describe the process we followed to design andimplement reusable scientific workflows for the climate sciences.In particular, we focus on carbon storage assessment by using ur-ban trees, a common requirement for cities to reduce their carbonemissions globally.
