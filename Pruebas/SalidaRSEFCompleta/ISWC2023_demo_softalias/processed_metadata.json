        "abstract": "AbstractResearch software (i.e., the tools and scripts developed as part of a research investigation) are key tosupport the results described in academic publications. However, current citation practices followed byresearchers make it difficult to automatically identify and reconcile the tools used in existing publications(different names are used for the same tool, different citing styles, etc.). In this demo we address thisissue by integrating SofCite, a state of the art named entity recognition model designed to find softwarementions in the biomedical domain, with Softalias-KG, a Knowledge Graph of software aliases, in orderto reconcile software tools in a text.Demo URL: https://w3id.org/softalias/demoCode: https://github.com/SoftwareUnderstanding/softalias-rsKeywordssoftware alias, software metadata, software reconciliation, knowledge graph1. IntroductionResearch Software [1] is increasingly becoming a first-class citizen research product due to itsrole in supporting computational results.1 Open platforms like Papers with Code2 or OpenAire3are dedicated to tracking the links between research articles and code, and paper preprintarchives like Arxiv4 are starting to display such information to readers.In order to ease software citation, the scientific community has developed guidelines andsoftware citation formats for developers [2]. However, researchers often use different namesto refer to the tools they refer to in their work. For example, the “Statistical Package for theSocial Sciences”5 is also known as “SPSS” and “SPSS Statistics” among many other variations.This makes tool reconciliation challenging, making it difficult to provide tool developers theircorresponding credit.In this work introduce Softalias-KG, a Knowledge Graph of software aliases created from arecent analysis and software mention dataset of over 3.8 million papers from PubMed Central [3].ISWC 2023 Posters and Demos: 22nd International Semantic Web Conference, November 6–10, 2023, Athens, GreeceEnvelope-Open egonzalez@fi.upm.es (E.
