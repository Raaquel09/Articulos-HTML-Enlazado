Pataki](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3482-0325)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document specifies a method, known as _RO-Crate_ (Research Object Crate), of aggregating and describing data for distribution, re-use, publishing, preservation and archiving. RO-Crates aggregate data into a Dataset, and may describe any resource including files, URI-addressable resources, or use other addressing schemes to locate digital or physical data. Describing resources includes technical metadata such as file sizes and types as well as contextual information including how and where datasets and files were created, how they were collated and collected, who was involved in the process, what equipment and software was used, who funded the work, how to cite it, and crucially, how it may be reused, and by whom.\r\n\r\nThe core of RO-Crate is a machine-readable linked-data document in JSON-LD format known as an **RO-Crate Metadata Document**. RO-Crate metadata documents can, to a large extent, be created and processed just like any other JSON: knowledge of JSON-LD is not needed, unless extending RO-Crate with additional concepts or combining RO-Crate with other Linked Data technologies.\r\n\r\nWhile providing the formal specification for RO-Crate, this document also aims to be a practical guide for software authors to create tools for generating and consuming research data packages, with explanation by examples. \r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* RO-Crate 1.2.0\r\n  * Clarified that the [RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor MUST have `@id` of `ro-crate-metadata.json`](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-RC1/root-data-entity#ro-crate-metadata-descriptor) by removing conflicting statements elsewhere in the specification [#365](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/pull/365)\r\n  * Updated the Bioschemas namespace for properties from `https://bioschemas.org/ComputationalWorkflow#` to `https://bioschemas.org/properties/`. This change affects only the `input` and `output` properties in the [JSON-LD context](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-RC1/ro-crate-metadata.json).\r\n  * **Change**: Replaced [name-based algorithm for finding root](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-RC1/root-data-entity#finding-the-root-data-entity)  [#198](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/198) [#365](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/pull/365)\r\n  * Updated [algorithm to always use string filter to find root](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-RC1/appendix/relative-uris#finding-ro-crate-root-in-rdf-triple-stores)  [#189](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/189) [#421](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/pull/421)\r\n (see [algorithm](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-RC1/root-data-entity#finding-the-root-data-entity)) \r\n  * **Change**: [Files on the web](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-RC1/data-entities#data-entities-in-an-attached-ro-crate-that-are-also-on-the-web) should now use `contentUrl` for direct download [#259](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/259)  \r\n  * [Clarify entity terminology](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-RC1/contextual-entities#contextual-vs-data-entities) and [when File/Dataset entities are and are not data entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-RC1/data-entities) [#204](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/204) [#426](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/pull/426)\r\n  * Update [JSON-LD context](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-RC1/ro-crate-metadata.json) to [schema.org 22.0](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/tree/main/data/releases/22.0/). Note that upstream adds >230 terms, and removed terms `AuthenticContent` `MissingContext`, `constrainingProperty` (now `constraintProperty`), `measuredValue`, `observedNode` . [#263](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/263) [#274](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/274)\r\n  * Remove custom mapping of `funding` for Bioschemas (now officially <http://schema.org/funding>)\r\n  * Added `localPath` to JSON-LD context (<https://w3id.org/ro/terms#localPath>) and described its use in [web-based entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-RC1/data-entities#web-based-data-entities) [#406](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/pull/406)

RO-Crates can aggregate and describe any resource including files, URI-addressable resources, or use other addressing schemes to locate digital or physical data. RO-Crates can describe data in aggregate and at the individual resource level, with metadata to aid in discovery, re-use and long term management of data. Metadata includes the ability to describe the context of data and the entities involved in its production, use and reuse. For example: who created it, using which equipment, software and workflows, under what licenses can it be re-used, where was it collected, and/or where is it *about*.\r\n\r\nRO-Crate uses JSON-LD to to express this metadata using linked data, describing data resources as well as contextual entities such as people, organizations, software and equipment as a series of linked JSON-LD objects - using common published vocabularies, chiefly schema.org. \r\n\r\nThe core of RO-Crate is a JSON-LD file, the _RO-Crate Metadata File_, named `ro-crate-metadata.json`. This file contains structured metadata about the dataset as a whole (the _Root Data Entity_) and, optionally, about some or all of its files. This provides a simple way to, for example, assert the authors (e.g. people, organizations) of the RO-Crate or one its files, or to capture more complex provenance for files, such as how they were created using software and equipment. \r\n\r\nWhile providing the formal specification for RO-Crate, this document also aims to be a practical guide for software authors to create tools for generating and consuming research data packages, with explanation by examples. \r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* [RO-Crate 1.1.3](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/tag/1.1.3) \r\n  - JSON-LD context https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context fix typo in mapping from `RepositoryObject` to <http://pcdm.org/2016/04/18/models#Object> [#243](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/243) -- not `\u2026#object`\r\n\r\nNote that this release is otherwise identical to [1.1.2](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/tag/1.1.2) and therefore the remaining files still refer to `1.1.2`.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ResearchObject/ro-crate/tarball/1.1.3", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ResearchObject/ro-crate/zipball/1.1.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/tag/1.1.3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/100939666", "release_id": 100939666, "date_created": "2023-04-26T11:28:33Z", "date_published": "2023-04-26T11:44:33Z"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/56934591", "tag": "1.1.2", "name": "RO-Crate 1.1.2", "author": {"name": "stain", "type": "User"}, "description": "\r\n\r\n# RO-Crate Metadata Specification 1.1.2\r\n  \r\n* Permalink: <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1>\r\n* Published: 2022-01-19\r\n* Publisher: [researchobject.org](https://www.researchobject.org/) community\r\n* Status: Recommendation\r\n* JSON-LD context: <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context>\r\n* This version: <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1>\r\n* Alternate formats: [Web pages](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/),\r\n  [single-page HTML](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/download/1.1.2/ro-crate-1.1.2.html),\r\n  [PDF](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/download/1.1.2/ro-crate-1.1.2.html),\r\n  [RO-Crate JSON-LD](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/download/1.1.2/ro-crate-metadata.json), [RO-Crate HTML](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/download/1.1.2/ro-crate-preview.html)\r\n* Previous version: <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0>\r\n* Cite as: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5841615> (this version)\r\n  <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3406497> (any version)\r\n* Editors: [Peter Sefton](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X), [Eoghan \u00d3 Carrag\u00e1in](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8131-2150),  [Stian Soiland-Reyes](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9842-9718)\r\n* Authors: [Peter Sefton](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X), [Eoghan \u00d3 Carrag\u00e1in](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8131-2150),  [Stian Soiland-Reyes](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9842-9718), [Oscar Corcho](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9260-0753), [Daniel Garijo](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0454-7145), [Raul Palma](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4289-4922), [Frederik Coppens](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6565-5145), [Carole Goble](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1219-2137), [Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4806-5140), [Kyle Chard](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7370-4805), [Jose Manuel Gomez-Perez](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5491-6431), [Michael R Crusoe](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2961-9670), [Ignacio Eguinoa](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6190-122X), [Nick Juty](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2036-8350), [Kristi Holmes](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8420-5254), [Jason A.

This provides a simple way to, for example, assert the authors (e.g. people, organizations) of the RO-Crate or one its files, or to capture more complex provenance for files, such as how they were created using software and equipment. \r\n\r\nWhile providing the formal specification for RO-Crate, this document also aims to be a practical guide for software authors to create tools for generating and consuming research data packages, with explanation by examples. \r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* [RO-Crate 1.1.2](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/tag/1.1.2) \r\n  * Typo fixes in _data entity_ section [#177](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/177), _workflow section_ [#180](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/180), _metadata section_ [#181](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/181) and others.\r\n  * Correct namespace for `rdfs:comment` on _ad-hoc terms_ [#164](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/164)\r\n  * Fixed broken links to Bioschemas and SPAR ontologies [#185](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/185) (note: `conformsTo` URIs unchanged, will be updated in RO-Crate 1.2)\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ResearchObject/ro-crate/tarball/1.1.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ResearchObject/ro-crate/zipball/1.1.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/tag/1.1.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/56934591", "release_id": 56934591, "date_created": "2022-01-19T16:25:08Z", "date_published": "2022-01-19T16:26:48Z"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/38051503", "tag": "1.1.1", "name": "RO-Crate 1.1.1", "author": {"name": "stain", "type": "User"}, "description": "\r\n# RO-Crate Metadata Specification 1.1.1\r\n  \r\n* Permalink: <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1>\r\n* Published: 2020-10-30\r\n* Last updated: 2021-02-15\r\n* Publisher: [researchobject.org](https://www.researchobject.org/) community\r\n* Status: Recommendation\r\n* JSON-LD context: <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context>\r\n* This version: <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1>\r\n* Alternate formats: [Web pages](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/),\r\n  [single-page HTML](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/download/1.1.1/ro-crate-1.1.1.html),\r\n  [PDF](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/releases/download/1.1.1/ro-crate-1.1.1.html),\r\n  [RO-Crate JSON-LD](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/ro-crate-metadata.json), [RO-Crate HTML](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/ro-crate-preview.html)\r\n* Previous version: <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0>\r\n* Cite as: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4541002> (this version)\r\n  <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3406497> (any version)\r\n* Editors: [Peter Sefton](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X), [Stian Soiland-Reyes](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9842-9718)\r\n* Authors: [Peter Sefton](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X), [Eoghan \u00d3 Carrag\u00e1in](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8131-2150),  [Stian Soiland-Reyes](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9842-9718), [Oscar Corcho](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9260-0753), [Daniel Garijo](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0454-7145), [Raul Palma](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4289-4922), [Frederik Coppens](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6565-5145), [Carole Goble](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1219-2137), [Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4806-5140), [Kyle Chard](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7370-4805), [Jose Manuel Gomez-Perez](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5491-6431), [Michael R Crusoe](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2961-9670), [Ignacio Eguinoa](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6190-122X), [Nick Juty](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2036-8350), [Kristi Holmes](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8420-5254), [Jason A.

RO-Crates can aggregate and describe any resource including files, URI-addressable resources, or use other addressing schemes to locate digital or physical data. RO-Crates can describe data in aggregate and at the individual resource level, with metadata to aid in discovery, re-use and long term management of data. Metadata includes the ability to describe the context of data and the entities involved in its production, use and reuse.
