Dataset relates to 1 sheet of the excel. We selected the following attributes describing both of those core concepts.

There might be multiple datasets located inside the same file. We support this option but we restrict a single dataset per 1 sheet. If there are empty columns this is still treated as a single dataset in the resulting RO-crate metadata. We chose this approach is it can not be clearly identified where 1 dataset ends and the other one starts as for example the \"Total\" column of monthly sales can be separated by 1 empty column to increase the visibility. Each dataset is also required to have a header at 0th row to be able to convey the attribute information.  \nAs suggested by RO-crate we attempted to make use of the already existing ontologies. We reused the datacube ontology (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) to model the relationships of the columns to a dataset(sheet). We did not find an ontology for the specific terms we came up with which describe the dataset(sheet) and the columns and thus created our own xlsx2rocrate ontology. The ontology describes the metadata which are mentioned in the previous chapter. It can be found in the folder \"./ontology\".\nThe ontology has three classes: ExcelColumn, which represents column, ExcelSheet, which represents sheet, and ExcelWorkbook, which represents whole workbook. It has also two object properties: hasColumn and hasSheet. Data properties describes all column metadata and \"encoding\". \nWe support 3 types of columns in the following resolution order numeric, categorical, string. This means if a column is not deemed numeric, it is checked against a category threshold, default 10 unique strings, and if this check does not pass it is resolved as string.\nWe define additional properties based on the type of the column (for description of the properties see the first chapter)\n* numeric: - include range, some spread information, information if double or integer\n    * minimum\n    * maximum\n    * mean\n    * stdev\n    * integer\n* categorical: - list all categories and their proportions to define spread, include most numerous category and its properties\n    * category\n    * category_proportions\n    * mode_key\n    * mode_in_percent\n* string: - information about the length of the strings (range and spread) and whether the string is only alphanumeric\n    * minimum_length\n    * maximum_length\n    * average_length\n    * alpha_numeric\n    * stdev_length \nEach of the columns also contains the information whether it contains missing values (missing_values) and if so what the proportion the missing values represent (missing_values_proportion). Note that there is no support for custom missing value strings and only an empty string is considered to be a missing value (e.g. we do not support NaN or other abbreviations as of now).\n \n", "original_header": "Design decisions"}, "confidence": 0.9460742833115028, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e11938258/RO-Crates-and-Excel/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "The main usage of the application is to craete the RO-crate by parsing the metadata, sheets and columns from the selected excel and tries to build the model. This is done in 2 parts - first the xlsx file is unzipped and *docProps/app.xml* and *docProps/core.xml* are used to extract the author, creation/modification dates and the application information (name and version) respectively. Secondly the excel file is transformed into rdf triples using the excel ontology (https://github.com/allNormal/SpreadsheetTransformation) and then the aggregate information is built from that. In order to ensure non-conflicting context entity ids we implemented a synchronized store that provisions unique identifiers. This is also done for columns, as name of the column is its id, but a random unique suffix is added as the names don't have to be unique neither inside a signle sheet nor across the sheets. Afterwards the data is converted into JSON-LD entities and written into the RO-crate metadata (ro-crate-metadata.json). Finally the original file is copied over to the *data/* folder as required by the RO-crate specification. \nThe other flow is to generate excel files based on the RO-crate metadata to check how the data is described. This is done by reading the mandatory properties of the sheets and columns and generating valid values given the restrictions defined by the properties. As we do not store the exact distribution information for the string and numeric columns normal distribution with the provided mean (mean and average_length respectively) and standard deviation (stdev and stdev_length respectively) is used. For the categorical columns we make use of the proportions to generate the same distribution of each factor. However, due to the library used (http://poi.apache.org/download.html#POI-5.0.0) only 256 columns are supported in the generation (this is not a limit for the RO-creation). The generation is repeated for each sheet given the original sheets number of observations (rows).  \n", "original_header": "Implementation details"}, "confidence": 0.9809259860060768, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e11938258/RO-Crates-and-Excel/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "First of all the excel files describe the dataset on the column level somewhat reliably, albeit only normal distribution is used.

Those are not contained in the profile on purpose as they are not necessary for the description of the dataset (even though the formulas could provide insights but are hard to standardise in terms of feature connections inside a query and thus not very machine actionable). However, there are other column relationships that could be interesting for data synthesis that would capture the relationships in a bayesian network (e.g. as done in https://github.com/DataResponsibly/DataSynthesizer).
