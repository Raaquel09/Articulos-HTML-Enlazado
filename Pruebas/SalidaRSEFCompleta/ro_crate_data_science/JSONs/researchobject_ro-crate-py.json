repository\n\nro-crate-py is open source software distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. Contributions are welcome, but please read this guide first. Submitted contributions are assumed to be covered by section 5 of the [license](LICENSE).\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\n[Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) on your local machine, then [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository on GitHub and [create a local clone of your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork).\n\nFor instance, if your GitHub user name is `simleo`, you can get a local clone as follows:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/simleo/ro-crate-py\n```\n\nYou can see that the local clone is pointing to your remote fork:\n\n```\n$ cd ro-crate-py\n$ git remote -v\norigin\thttps://github.com/simleo/ro-crate-py (fetch)\norigin\thttps://github.com/simleo/ro-crate-py (push)\n```\n\nTo keep a reference to the original (upstream) repository, you can add a remote for it:\n\n```\n$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py\n$ git fetch upstream\n```\n\nThis allows, among other things, to easily keep your fork synced to the upstream repository through time. For instance, to sync your `master` branch:\n\n```\n$ git checkout master\n$ git fetch -p upstream\n$ git merge --ff-only upstream/master\n$ git push origin master\n```\n\nIf you need help with Git and GitHub, head over to the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github). In particular, you should be familiar with [issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).\n\n\n## Making a contribution\n\nContributions can range from fixing a broken link or a typo in the documentation to fixing a bug or adding a new feature to the software. Ideally, contributions (unless trivial) should be related to an [open issue](https://github.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/issues). If there is no existing issue or [pull request](https://github.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/pulls) related to the changes you wish to make, you can open a new one.\n\nMake your changes on a branch in your fork, then open a pull request (PR). Please take some time to summarize the proposed changes in the PR's description, especially if they're not obvious. If the PR addresses an open issue, you should [link it to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).\n\n\n## Contributing documentation\n\nCurrently, documentation consists of a few [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) files such as this one. Read the [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) guide for a quick introduction to the format. Before opening the PR, you can check that the document renders as expected by looking at the corresponding page on the relevant branch in your fork.\n\n\n## Contributing software\n\nro-crate-py is written in [Python](https://www.python.org). To isolate your development environment from the underlying system, you can use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html):\n\n```\n$ python3 -m venv venv\n$ source venv/bin/activate\n$ pip install --upgrade pip\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nFor development, it's recommended to install ro-crate-py in [editable mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html):\n\n```\npip install -e .\n```\n\nIn this way, any changes to the code will be picked up immediately, without the need to reinstall the package.\n\nWhen you're done with your work, you can deactivate the virtual environment by typing `deactivate` on your shell.\n\nBefore pushing any changes, make sure everything is fine by running the linting and testing commands as explained below.\n\n### Linting\n\nro-crate-py uses [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) for linting. The configuration is in `setup.cfg` and it's picked up automatically. If you have a `venv` directory or any other directory you don't want to be checked by Flake8, use the `--exclude` option.\n\n```\npip install flake8\nflake8 --exclude venv ./\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nTesting is done with [pytest](https://pytest.org):\n\n```\npip install pytest\npytest test\n```\n\nIf a test is failing, you can get more information by enabling verbose mode and stdout/stderr dump. For instance:\n\n```\npytest -sv test/test_write.py::test_remote_uri_exceptions\n```\n\nIdeally, every code contribution should come with new unit tests that add coverage for the bug fix or new feature.\n\n### Using the Docker image for development\n\nro-crate-py is currently a fairly simple library that does not require any special infrastructure setup, so virtual environments should be enough for development. However, if you want a higher degree of isolation, you can build the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image with:\n\n```\ndocker build -t ro-crate-py .\n```\n\nAnd then run it interactively with:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -it --name ro-crate-py ro-crate-py bash\n```\n\n\n## Tidying up after PR merge\n\nAfter your PR has been merged, you can delete the branch used for your changes. You can delete the remote branch from GitHub, by clicking on \"Delete branch\" in the PR's page. To resync everything, run:\n\n```\ngit checkout master\ngit fetch -p upstream\ngit merge --ff-only upstream/master\ngit push origin master\ngit branch -d <pr_branch_name>\n```\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "package_id": [{"result": {"value": "rocrate", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/setup.py"}], "authors": [{"result": {"name": null, "email": "stain@apache.org", "type": "Agent", "value": "stain@apache.org"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/setup.py"}], "readme_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/README.md", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "executable_example": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/notebooks/ExploreSchemaOrg.ipynb", "type": "Url", "format": "jupyter_notebook"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/notebooks/ExploreSchemaOrg.ipynb"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/notebooks/ROcrate-linked-data.ipynb", "type": "Url", "format": "jupyter_notebook"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/notebooks/ROcrate-linked-data.ipynb"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/notebooks/ROcrate-validation.ipynb", "type": "Url", "format": "jupyter_notebook"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/notebooks/ROcrate-validation.ipynb"}], "continuous_integration": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/.github/workflows/python-package.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/.github/workflows/python-publish.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "has_script_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/rocrate/data/update.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "type": [{"result": {"value": "commandline-application", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 0.82, "technique": "software_type_heuristics"}], "installation": [{"result": {"value": "ro-crate-py requires Python 3.9 or later.

This file contains metadata about the other files and directories, represented by [data entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/data-entities.html). These metadata consist both of properties of the data entities themselves and of other, non-digital entities called [contextual entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/contextual-entities.html). A contextual entity can represent, for instance, a person, an organization or an event.\n\nSuppose Alice and Bob worked on a research task together, which resulted in a manuscript written by both; additionally, Alice prepared a spreadsheet containing the experimental data, which Bob used to generate a diagram. We will create placeholder files for these documents:\n\n```bash\nmkdir exp\ntouch exp/paper.pdf\ntouch exp/results.csv\ntouch exp/diagram.svg\n```\n\nLet's make an RO-Crate to package all this:\n\n```python\nfrom rocrate.rocrate import ROCrate\n\ncrate = ROCrate()\npaper = crate.add_file(\"exp/paper.pdf\", properties={\n    \"name\": \"manuscript\",\n    \"encodingFormat\": \"application/pdf\"\n})\ntable = crate.add_file(\"exp/results.csv\", properties={\n    \"name\": \"experimental data\",\n    \"encodingFormat\": \"text/csv\"\n})\ndiagram = crate.add_file(\"exp/diagram.svg\", dest_path=\"images/figure.svg\", properties={\n    \"name\": \"bar chart\",\n    \"encodingFormat\": \"image/svg+xml\"\n})\n```\n\nThe `dest_path` argument is used to specify the relative path of the file with respect to the crate's directory (which will be determined when the crate is written). Note that the first two `add_file` calls do not specify `dest_path`: in this case, it will be set to the source file's basename (`\"paper.pdf\"` in the first case), so the file will be at the crate's top level when it is written.\n\nWe've started by adding the data entities. Now we need contextual entities to represent Alice and Bob:\n\n```python\nfrom rocrate.model.person import Person\n\nalice_id = \"https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000\"\nbob_id = \"https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001\"\nalice = crate.add(Person(crate, alice_id, properties={\n    \"name\": \"Alice Doe\",\n    \"affiliation\": \"University of Flatland\"\n}))\nbob = crate.add(Person(crate, bob_id, properties={\n    \"name\": \"Bob Doe\",\n    \"affiliation\": \"University of Flatland\"\n}))\n```\n\nAt this point, we have a representation of the various entities. Now we need to express the relationships between them. This is done by adding properties that reference other entities:\n\n```python\npaper[\"author\"] = [alice, bob]\ntable[\"author\"] = alice\ndiagram[\"author\"] = bob\n```\n\nYou can also add whole directories together with their contents. In an RO-Crate, a directory is represented by the `Dataset` entity. Create a directory with some placeholder files:\n\n```bash\nmkdir exp/logs\ntouch exp/logs/log1.txt\ntouch exp/logs/log2.txt\n```\n\nNow add it to the crate:\n\n```python\nlogs = crate.add_dataset(\"exp/logs\")\n```\n\nFinally, we serialize the crate to disk:\n\n```python\ncrate.write(\"exp_crate\")\n```\n\nNow the `exp_crate` directory should contain copies of all the files we added and an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file with a [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) representation of the entities and relationships we created, with the following layout:\n\n```\nexp_crate/\n|-- images/\n|   `-- figure.svg\n|-- logs/\n|   |-- log1.txt\n|   `-- log2.txt\n|-- paper.pdf\n|-- results.csv\n`-- ro-crate-metadata.json\n```\n\nExploring the `exp_crate` directory, we see that all files and directories contained in `exp/logs` have been added recursively to the crate. However, in the `ro-crate-metadata.json` file, only the top level Dataset with `@id` `\"exp/logs\"` is listed. This is because we used `crate.add_dataset(\"exp/logs\")` rather than adding every file individually. There is no requirement to represent every file and folder within the crate in the `ro-crate-metadata.json` file. If you do want to add files and directories recursively to the metadata, use `crate.add_tree` instead of `crate.add_dataset` (but note that it only works on local directory trees).\n\nSome applications and services support RO-Crates stored as archives. To save the crate in zip format, use `write_zip`:\n\n```python\ncrate.write_zip(\"exp_crate.zip\")\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Creating an RO-Crate", "parent_header": ["Usage"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "What ro-crate-py entities actually store is their JSON representation:\n\n```python\npaper.properties()\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@id\": \"paper.pdf\",\n  \"@type\": \"File\",\n  \"name\": \"manuscript\",\n  \"encodingFormat\": \"application/pdf\",\n  \"author\": [\n    {\"@id\": \"https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000\"},\n    {\"@id\": \"https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001\"},\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWhen `paper[\"author\"]` is accessed, a new list containing the `alice` and `bob` entities is generated on the fly. For this reason, calling `append` on `paper[\"author\"]` won't actually modify the `paper` entity in any way. To add an author, use the `append_to` method instead:\n\n```python\ndonald = crate.add(Person(crate, \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck\", properties={\n  \"name\": \"Donald Duck\"\n}))\npaper.append_to(\"author\", donald)\n```\n\nNote that `append_to` also works if the property to be updated is missing or has only one value:\n\n```python\nfor n in \"Mickey_Mouse\", \"Scrooge_McDuck\":\n    p = crate.add(Person(crate, f\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{n}\"))\n    donald.append_to(\"follows\", p)\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Appending elements to property values", "parent_header": ["Usage", "Creating an RO-Crate"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "Since RO-Crate entity identifiers are URIs (relative or absolute), special characters in them must be percent-encoded.

In other cases, you can explicitly pass the type via the `properties` argument:\n\n```python\nfrom rocrate.model.contextentity import ContextEntity\n\nhackathon = crate.add(ContextEntity(crate, \"#bh2021\", properties={\n    \"@type\": \"Hackathon\",\n    \"name\": \"Biohackathon 2021\",\n    \"location\": \"Barcelona, Spain\",\n    \"startDate\": \"2021-11-08\",\n    \"endDate\": \"2021-11-12\"\n}))\n```\n\nNote that entities can have multiple types, e.g.:\n\n```python\n    \"@type\" = [\"File\", \"SoftwareSourceCode\"]\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Adding entities with an arbitrary type", "parent_header": ["Usage", "Creating an RO-Crate"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "An existing RO-Crate package can be loaded from a directory or zip file:\n\n```python\ncrate = ROCrate('exp_crate')  # or ROCrate('exp_crate.zip')\nfor e in crate.get_entities():\n    print(e.id, e.type)\n```\n\n```\n./ Dataset\nro-crate-metadata.json CreativeWork\npaper.pdf File\nresults.csv File\nimages/figure.svg File\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000 Person\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001 Person\n```\n\nThe first two entities shown in the output are the [root data entity](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/root-data-entity.html) and the [metadata file descriptor](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/metadata.html), respectively. The former represents the whole crate, while the latter represents the metadata file. These are special entities managed by the `ROCrate` object, and are always present. The other entities are the ones we added in the [section on RO-Crate creation](#creating-an-ro-crate).\n\nAs shown above, `get_entities` allows to iterate over all entities in the crate. You can also access only data entities with `crate.data_entities` and only contextual entities with `crate.contextual_entities`. For instance:\n\n```python\nfor e in crate.data_entities:\n    author = e.get(\"author\")\n    if not author:\n        continue\n    elif isinstance(author, list):\n        print(e.id, [p[\"name\"] for p in author])\n    else:\n        print(e.id, repr(author[\"name\"]))\n```\n\n```\npaper.pdf ['Alice Doe', 'Bob Doe']\nresults.csv 'Alice Doe'\nimages/figure.svg 'Bob Doe'\n```\n\nYou can fetch an entity by its `@id` as follows:\n\n```python\narticle = crate.dereference(\"paper.pdf\")\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Consuming an RO-Crate", "parent_header": ["Usage"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "```bash\n# From the ro-crate-py repository root\ncd test/test-data/ro-crate-galaxy-sortchangecase\n```\n\nThis directory is already an RO-Crate. Delete the metadata file to get a plain directory tree:\n\n```bash\nrm ro-crate-metadata.json\n```\n\nNow the directory tree contains several files and directories, including a Galaxy workflow and a Planemo test file, but it's not an RO-Crate since there is no metadata file. Initialize the crate:\n\n```bash\nrocrate init\n```\n\nThis creates an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file that lists files and directories rooted at the current directory. Note that the Galaxy workflow is listed as a plain `File`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@id\": \"sort-and-change-case.ga\",\n  \"@type\": \"File\"\n}\n```\n\nTo register the workflow as a `ComputationalWorkflow`:\n\n```bash\nrocrate add workflow -l galaxy sort-and-change-case.ga\n```\n\nNow the workflow has a type of `[\"File\", \"SoftwareSourceCode\", \"ComputationalWorkflow\"]` and points to a `ComputerLanguage` entity that represents the Galaxy workflow language. Also, the workflow is listed as the crate's `mainEntity` (this is required by the [Workflow RO-Crate profile](https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/1.0), a subtype of RO-Crate which provides extra specifications for workflow metadata).\n\nTo add [workflow testing metadata](https://crs4.github.io/life_monitor/workflow_testing_ro_crate) to the crate:\n\n```bash\nrocrate add test-suite -i '#test1'\nrocrate add test-instance '#test1' http://example.com -r jobs -i '#test1_1'\nrocrate add test-definition '#test1' test/test1/sort-and-change-case-test.yml -e planemo -v '>=0.70'\n```\n\nTo add files or directories after crate initialization:\n\n```bash\ncp ../sample_file.txt .\nrocrate add file sample_file.txt -P name=sample -P description=\"Sample file\"\ncp -r ../test_add_dir .\nrocrate add dataset test_add_dir\n```\n\nThe above example also shows how to set arbitrary properties for the entity with `-P`. This is supported by most `rocrate add` subcommands.\n\n```console\n$ rocrate add workflow --help\nUsage: rocrate add workflow [OPTIONS] PATH\n\nOptions:\n  -l, --language [cwl|galaxy|knime|nextflow|snakemake|compss|autosubmit]\n                                  The workflow language.\n  -c, --crate-dir PATH            The path to the root data entity of the\n                                  crate.
