        "abstract": "AbstractOntologies and vocabularies play a key role when standardising, organizing and integrating data fromheterogeneous data sources into Knowledge Graphs. In order to develop ontologies, different engineeringmethodologies have been proposed throughout the years, whose application resulted in thousands ofsemantic artefacts (taxonomies, vocabularies and ontologies) in a wide range of domains. But how toensure that ontologies follow the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable principles (FAIR) fromtheir inception? In this paper, we review: (i) existing guidelines to help make ontologies FAIR and (ii)published FAIRness assessment methodologies and map them to the ontology development lifecycleactivities. Our analysis outlines the current gaps, where no guidelines exist for ontologies to becomeFAIR-by-design.KeywordsOntology Engineering, FAIR principles, FAIRness assessment, FAIR-by-design, Semantic Artefacts,Ontologies, Vocabularies1. IntroductionOntologies and vocabularies play a key role in data integration by defining the structure, guidingthe construction, and validating Knowledge Graphs.
