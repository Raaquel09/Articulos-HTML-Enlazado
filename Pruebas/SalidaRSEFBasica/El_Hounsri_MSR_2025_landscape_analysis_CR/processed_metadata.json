This paper examines how different scientific communitiesdescribe Research Software with metadata to support FAIR,how do they adopt existing good practices regarding citation,documentation or versioning, and what is the current adoptionof archival services for long-term preservation. We carry outour analysis in the software registries of five science clusters(in domains ranging from Physics to Environmental Sciences),together with a multi-domain collaborative software registry.Our results highlight the main gaps in metadata adoption inthe different communities, opening an opportunity for futurecontributions to aid researchers in adopting good FAIR and OpenScience practices.Index Terms—Research Software, Metadata, FAIR software,FAIR principles, Guidelines.I. INTRODUCTIONResearch Software, i.e., the code files, scripts, tools, orworkflows involved in or produced throughout the researchlifecycle [1] plays a pivotal role in modern scientific re-search, to support the research outputs described in scientificpublications. Understanding the role of Research Softwareis essential not only for supporting research efficiency butalso for ensuring reproducibility. In this regard, the scientificcommunity has promoted initiatives towards adopting OpenScience best practices, such as the Findable, Accessible,Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles for data [2],which have also been extended for Research Software [3].The adoption of FAIR is expected to ease the reuse of dataand software while allowing automated systems to retrieve andinteroperate with (meta)data. In fact, compliance with FAIRis now part of the agenda of international organizations suchas the European Commission, through the European OpenScience Cloud initiative [4], or NASA [5].11https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/In order to ease the adoption of FAIR and Open Science,several efforts have developed guidelines, lessons, and goodpractices for researchers to improve the metadata available intheir code repositories (e.g., the Research Software MetaDataGuidelines (RSMD) [6], Software Carpentry2, Open SourceSecurity Foundation3, etc.). However, it is unclear how thesepractices are adopted by different scientific communities,making it challenging to assess their impact.In this paper, we address this issue by assessing the adoptionof Research Software metadata best practices (inspired by",
